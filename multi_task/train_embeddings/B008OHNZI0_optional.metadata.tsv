0.042051762	0.51684654	Nice but during application bubbles form and wouldn't go away and when pushing bubbles, scratch marks appeared. Have had the screen protectors for about a week and already tons of scratches.
0.9808214	0.8058417	As suggested by the provider, I installed the screen protector following the directions described and everything got great!!! No dust, no bubbles and the screen protector is almost invisible!!!The key:* Clean your hands* Remove any dust and grease from the screen* Avoid contact with the screen and the adhesive side of the protector* Install in a wind-free environment* Be patient!!!Great product!!!
0.039629847	0.45923859999999994	It's difficult to line up the protector. There is only 1 REMOVE ME sticker instead of two of them like the instruction describes. The Matte finish is terrible and makes the screen looks so much older. Get a clear finish protector.
0.8941962999999999	0.7630249	This was very easy to put on, went on straight, no air bubbles. Did not watch the video, didn't need to. I hate fingerprints so love the matte finish, but it does take away some of the screen resolution, but just slightly.
0.60998285	0.7254529000000001	There are a lot of screen protectors out there but actual product experience vary a lot... Compare to the last one I tried (HandHeldItems anti-glare for iPhone 5) this lot is much better in term of getting the job done (protecting the screen) while being invisible - that is to give almost the same experience than the naked screen with no color artifacts, same brightness without extra glare. It applies pretty much like other screen protectors (clean the screen, remove one plastic layer, apply then remove the other layer and you are done). I do not know if this is luck or through a better design but I ended up having no single bubble trapped.Tips available on the manufacturer website can help to achieve a good result: [...]Based on this, a very reasonable cost, and a good buying & shipping experience, I highly recommend this item.
0.36234316	0.61795413	I got iPhone 5 before I got the screen protector, but way after the specs for the phone were available to the public and manufacturers.Everything is good with the protector, except for 1 major flow: the openings for the front camera and headphone ear speaker are oversized compare to the actual device. No I have a large oval around the camera and larger oval around the ear speaker. In the same time the opening for the &#34;Home&#34; button is a precise cut, so I think the design is off.
0.82715243	0.76366705	All of the things said about this screen are true-- glare resistant, fingerprint resistant. Goes on easy, feels solid. I especially wanted something that was fingerprint resistant because my other screen protector would get all grimy and it would drive me crazy. So this one does the job. But the matte texture makes me aware of the fact that I have a screen protector on-- I can kind of &#34;see it&#34; when looking at my screen. I could tell it would be good if i were outside more often. And since the iphone screen is crystal clear, I REALLY don't like muting that. I think I would've preferred the HD clear-- I think it was an impulse purchase and next time I'm going to get the HD clear. Make sure you know which one you are purchasing before you buy.
0.71292865	0.64451444	Great Product... just make extra sure your phone is clean.  I wasted the first one because I just wiped the screen real quick.  Comes with a cloth and a card to get the bubbles out.  Second try I wiped it down real well but still had 1 speck of something but decided to deal with it. Most problems will have more to do with the operator than the product.
0.67331266	0.7124001999999999	I ordered both the matte and the clear screen protectors for my iphone 5.  I noticed that the clear protectors have 2 tabs, one that when removed exposes the side that adheres to the screen, and the other that when removed exposes the side of the protector that you touch when applied.  This is not the case with the matte protectors, which only have a tab that when removed exposes the side which adheres to the screen.  Other than that, they are a little on the narrow side, which combined with my case causes mine to come up a bit on the edges.  On a positive note they do seem to go on relatively bubble free and they do feel superb to other brands I have used.
0.99287736	0.80876255	Very nice iphone screen protector. 3 pieces in a package. Well priced and easy to install. The HD clear screen is practically invisible!
0.99390614	0.8142104	I had spent $30 on a zagg protector which I have removed from my iPhone. Problem is that along the edges, the zagg would bubble up. I hated that especially for an expensive one. Then I came upon Tech Armor. I simply love it. It comes with three protectors. I used two before applying it to my satisfaction. :) I highly recommend this product to all iPhone users. I would have paid $30 for this and it is certainly worth it.
0.19461337	0.53540707	It has lasted about three months but need to be replaced now. I will probably just buy some more of these
0.96937335	0.66959417	If you are sensitive about your privacy you should buy this product it is awesome.In addition to keeping your information safe and private, it protects your screen from dust and other damages.
0.005805671	0.23626798	As much as I don't like giving bad reviews, I have to do it this time. This protector is very hard/impossible to put on your screen. I followed the instructions online and even watched the video three times. Still, I wasted all three protectors and I still don't have the protector placed the way it should be. Waste of my money and time.
0.02122271	0.45136207	They were impossible to attach without bubbling and when they were attached they were prone to self removal. I would not recommend  this product to anyone. Better not to have any screen protector at all.
0.671876	0.2746155	espero que me sirva para proteger mi IPhone por mucho tiempo, son de buena presentaci&oacute;n, los recomiendo para la compra
0.21733743	0.42585015	I have used many screen protectors to guard my devices over the years and I thought I had settled on another company called Power Support. I purchased it and it was terrible so I went with this one.The screen of the iPhone 5 is breathtaking, it is as if there is no protector on it. Worth every dollar and probably more!
0.7236541	0.5589005	Not that hard to put on, not sure why people are having a problem with it; but I did watch the video and it took me one quick try. Clear, strong, can't even tell its there when looking at the phone's screen.
0.91315854	0.61158454	This is great! No one can see what I'm doing they all think I'm looking at a blank screen! :)
0.96577704	0.7545270000000001	Works great, a little tough to get on at first, but I'm glad I went this this case, and not a different one.
0.99408907	0.83184284	Bought these a few weeks back and wanted to wait before I wrote a review on them. Great case. Easy to apply, I love the matte finish because no fingerprints on the screen, and durable enough that my 2 year old was messing around with my phone and it didn't scratch at all. I put one on my wife's phone and it was a perfect fit. When I went to put one on my phone it doesn't line up perfect. But the difference is barely noticeable so I still give it 5 stars. Will definitely order more in the future.
0.9671445	0.80770904	The screen protector arrived as described - anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. Installation is a breeze. I just tried it once and everything fell into place. Since I placed it slowly, there was no problems of bubbles on the screen and there was no need to use the supplied card. I just needed to smooth out the edges. In summary, this screen protector meets my expectations for it's affordable price.
0.88936925	0.5706625	I'm very happy to have this protection on the face of my phone - I can't even tell it's on! I like that the company sent a follow-up email, complete with video instructions, and several protectors (since I ruined one right away). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I still had to bring it into the store and ask one of the guys to put it on for me. I just couldn't get it right, but he did.
0.5169814	0.5320387	It did the job the only thing I would change about it is.... It's way 2 dark my phone dies much faster because I have to turn up the brightness
0.9974563	0.7750503000000001	This product is Easy to apply and sticks nicely. I would definitely recommend to anyone and buy more if needed.
0.9872322	0.7617505999999999	The screen protector is easy to install and the matte finish is very good! With life time replacement and three total in the package a very good choice to protect your electronic toys!
0.8604616	0.6405624	The screen protector works very well, and like virtually all of the others, was a bear to put on. Having a protective film on both sides of the protective film was extremely beneficial.
0.9974437	0.8336978	I love this cover - better than the bestbuy/at&t covers sold at the stores. This even came with three and I feel good about having backups in case this one gets a scratch in it while protecting the glass. No bubbles and easy to install just follow the directions.
0.99787164	0.8267138	Easy to install and work perfectly as expected. looks nice and not much glare and minimal fingerprints. Great product and great price
0.87372065	0.76790994	3-pack arrived promptly. No problem installing it on three of our new iPhone 5s; I managed to avoid having bubbles on all of them. Fit was very good. We put cases on all three and the screen protectors do not interfere with them.
0.9632248999999999	0.7896626	It's easy to install (if you bother to read instructions). I also cherish the fact that there are no messy liquids, it comes like a sticker. You only need to be careful in setting the edges. It took me less than 2 mins. PLS. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!Perfectly clear screen protector, you can't tell there's anything on the screen.
0.99880916	0.9125858	After looking at several screen protectors for the new iPhone 5, I was torn between this one and another one by a different brand. At the end, I chose this one, and I am so happy that I made this purchase. The screen protectors come with instructions, a cleaning cloth, a card for bubbles, and even tape to get rid of dust in the screen before applying these.It was very easy to apply. As long as you follow the instructions, and make sure there's no dust in your screen, you will have absolutely NO BUBBLES. When the HD screen protector is on, it looks as if there's no screen protector on the screen. The iPhone screen looks beautiful with it. Tech Armor made it possible for the screen to be protected, and, at the same time, to enjoy the retina display that comes in the iPhone. With this product, you won't be sacrificing protection for quality; you'll have both.Furthermore, this company really stands behind their advertised Lifetime Warranty. They really do mean it. I contacted customer service because of a small issues I had, which was my fault, and they replied to me within minutes, and solved my issue very easily.Although these are somewhat expensive, it's worth every single penny. Sure, you can find on eBay some screen protectors from China that are .99 cents and even free shipping, but they won't come as close to this one. Besides, you are guaranteed a warranty for life with this product! If you spent hundreds of dollars by buying your iPhone 5, then I recommend you spend $7 more so you can protect your screen from scratches, and still enjoy the phone's vibrant colors.Thank you, Tech Armor.
0.54175186	0.6477421	I've had screen protectors in the past that have generally been awful. This screen protector, on the other hand, is very easy to install! I literally got it on, without bubbles and without dust, with one shot.
0.91293114	0.68103045	The product is great and protect phone from scratches. The application is little messy, but if you keep a paper napkin(bounty) handy that will help. The customer service is also great. I received the product damaged, and they sent me the replacement right away.The only issue, I have with this product as it's little thick, and it leaves nail marks(if you have big nails).Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
0.9988382	0.8213484000000001	This is the best screen protector I've purchased in a few years.  It was a perfect fit for iphone 5.  Easy to install and it looks flawless.  Will buy again for sure.
0.98621655	0.7629322	item was shipped on time. it's a good quality screen protector, I saw the video to put on and I added my own step I used a eye glass solution to clean the screen and sprayed the sticky side applied to iPhone screen and squeezed all the excess air and solution out, it looks perfect no air bubbles.  I like how screen protector feels on your fingertips and is fingerprint proof. excellent product
0.99101424	0.8484712	Nice screen protector for the iPhone 5. Very happy with the purchase. Just a few things to mention:*Comes in a package of three, which is handy in case of screw-ups.*It went on very easily compared to other screen protectors I've used before. No air bubbles at all and only took a couple of minutes to get it right.*The enclosed polishing cloth is useful for cleaning the screen protector.*I can't really speak to how well the product protects the screen at this point but it seems well-equipped to do what it's supposed to do*No problems at all using the touch screen after installing. Everything is just as responsive as before the protector went on.
0.26470625	0.49382487	You might think this product sounds like the bees knees on paper but it's very difficult to apply without trapping dust under the screen protector or getting the armor to line up precisely with the iPhone 5's various ports, speakers and rights angles. By all means give it a try and if you achieve satisfactory results more power to you; it doesn't cost the earth. I wound up wasting all 3 of the applicators without success and had a mini-meltdown in the process. If this sounds like wanton stupidity on my part, disregard my observations. But if you're familiar with and subject to this kind of perfectionist obsession with tech-gear, then purchase under advisement.
0.0060234369999999995	0.5555352	Where do I begin&#8230; on second thoughts I don&#8217;t even want to waist my energy on this.The product came in a different packing which was not &#8220;Tech Armor&#8221; , it looked like some one had just packed them at home !!!The cuts don&#8217;t match the phone style .. for example the round cut for camera lens was in oval shape, the cut for speaker was way bigger than required. I have applied screen protectors on the phone before, usually it is a delicate art but I am decent at it, but this one was a mess, I wasted 2 screen protectors before successfully applying the third one. Total waste of time and energy. Tech Armor is a good product but I have a suspicion this was just cheap screen protector and was not Tech Armor. I would strongly advise to &#8220;stay away from this product from this seller&#8221; .
0.9986969000000001	0.84681123	This iPad case with elastic straps makes holding my iPad so much easier than my previous one. I can slide my hand in horizontally or vertically and hold it at convenient angles. It's great and love it!
0.9609138	0.78049606	Used if for over 1 month already and to me, it's best screen protector I tried so far. Love the matte look.  was easy to install on the first try and 0 bubbles.I did install in in the bathroom next to the running water to avoid dust particles.
0.41416976	0.60221016	easy to put on. impossible not to have little bubbles on your screen. for the price, it's fine
0.7637901999999999	0.66707146	It is what it is.  It adheres to the screen and protects the surface of my phone.  There are small bubbles under the film, but that is not a big deal.  Works fine.  I'm very fussy about keeping my screen scratch-free.
0.99095774	0.77297556	This product fits the iPhone 5 very well and it was very easy to apply. I was able to get one on after the first try, so now I have 2 more as backups! Great product!
0.8878048000000001	0.5373127	The screen Protector are good and nice as one of the employee of att put for me and its smooth and nice i like it.You should know how to put it or have somebody put it.
0.9670595999999999	0.7901372	Tech Armor screen protector is just a great product.Check the video on tech armor website prior to installation, It was easy to install the screen protector though i got couple bubbles which were not fixableI would strongly recommend this product, On my IPhone 4s I spent $30 at Zagg for screen protector, Not worth if we have a product like Tech Armor on Amazon.When i placed the order last week, price was $5.95 and now I see it went up by $1 to $6.95, Still I gave 5 stars for the product quality and ease of use
0.80209434	0.7026928000000001	This is my second purchase of the Tech Armor.  My phone recently fell onto a rock and I was worried about the screen especially after I noticed a ding in the protector.  I removed the protector and the screen was intact.  The brunt of the fall and the ding remained with the screen protector.  Using my phone for a week without the anti-glare was noticeable.  I willo not use my phone without this going forward.
0.8145503000000001	0.6646363000000001	I have had this screen saver on my phone from the day it was new.  I finally got a scratch on the film that bubbled up...AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR!!!  They send you three films, so just peel this one off, clean the screen, and put a new one on.  Great deal!!!
0.9943985000000001	0.81943697	The protector did not leave any bubbles. It was a perfect fit and protects my screen like a charm. Worth the buy
0.031096071	0.47573528	Did not cover the screen completely. And the cutting for the speaker and camera are not centered. I have seen cheaper screen guards which fit perfectly. Thoroughly disappointing for a branded product.
0.49561486	0.5545988000000001	I ordered this product for my Iphone 5 and found it to be my savior, happen that I was talking in the men room and it become loose from my hand and fall to the floor it crash on it, my heart stop, oh no my Iphone, new Iphone, to replace it mean 6 or 7 houndred dolllars, well  it was working like before, the otter box save me,  and the screen protector make my phone screen look like new, the 2 of them are a good combination
0.0106191635	0.5877321	Would stay stuck on phone. Loved the privacy part of it. I was very disappointed that it didn't work. .
0.9811847	0.776166	The screen protector is greatIt is easy to install with a little of patienceI would recommend this product
0.024247587	0.28999590000000003	Hey Guys,This product is not too bad to apply but the quality of the product is terrible. The iphone 5 screen now looks fuzzy.
0.9986414	0.839767	Was easy to install and fits perfect on the screen!  Just bought this for my iPad mini also!  :  )
0.66875696	0.57421046	Got on time, look like nice product! Screen not thick and attach very well to iphone. An advice, take it
0.9977795	0.8303664000000001	i've been using Tech Armor products for years.  the quality is great, the product lasts, and their customer service is unbeatable.  they really do stand by their warranty.  it's a rare and winning combination in this modern day.
0.22435951	0.39141142	Can't use the front-facing camera with this screen protector-- it covers up the tiny lens and makes things all blurry.
0.012727648000000001	0.37585425	Awful. Don't buy! I'm going with the invisibleshield now. The layer leaves a sticky and tacky feeling when you move your finger around your phone. I hated it and bubbles were everywhere even when I used the &#34;squeegy&#34; to get them out.
0.064741105	0.48755854	Instead of a round hole for the home button, there is a U-shaped cut-out. So it is not protecting my entire front screen. Also, one of the three protectors was bent when I received. So, effectively I paid price of 3 for 2 protectors. And even those 2 don't meet my expectations. What a rip off!! Shipping with Amazon prime was fast. The screen protector otherwise has acceptable quality.
0.88975763	0.7661892	Got this today and I must say Its great. I have an anti glare/fingerprint cover for my ipad and itouch and this is just like those. Finger prints are no where to be found. Has a different feeling obviously from the clear protective screens.Only con with any Anti-glare/fingerprint is that it messes with the retina display. Not by a lot but you do notice it. However for me It does not really matter
0.98738813	0.6955485	I got exactly what I wanted. It is super easy to apply and has step by step directions. The only minor complaint would be it shows when there is a scratch but it's not that noticeable. There are extras in the pack so it's easy to switch them out.
0.9442351999999999	0.61782265	I am pleased so far, it is hard to get the screens on w/o a little bubble or 2. but no big deal for me. It's doing the job
0.97202694	0.75126374	After getting a Tech Armor for my iPad I immediately sent off for one for my iPhone. Super easy to apply and they give you 3 in a pack.
0.3819949	0.5933505	I think this product had potential. It seems like ti would be good once its on. However, I had to go through all three of them till I got it to work. The dust tape was great. I was just a little disappointed the first two did not stick but overall it is a good product.
0.7668023	0.6363205	I've never been fully satisfied with these protectors on any of the phones I've had, even going back to Palm PDA. And I NEVER get all the air bubbles out. That was until now. The little video on the website makes all the difference in the world. Follow the instructions to a T and you'll have a crystal clear view. I was so excited...I wrote this review.
0.9970597	0.83584225	When I ordered this screen protector, I honestly didn't know what to expect. Some of the other brands and items I've bought from Amazon definitely don't give Amazon a good name. But I can promise you, if you go with Tech Armor, you won't be unhappy.  Some of the things I love about Tech Armor privacy screen protectors are: 1. Anti-Glare and Anti-Smudge, I hate having a dirty or greasy phone! 2. Thick layer of protection! I love the Apple design of the iPhone 5 and I prefer not to cover up its beauty with a case so the thick screen protector is amazing because I don't have to worry about dropping it and breaking the glass. 3. Very easy application, comes with instructions and I strongly suggest using the Dust Removal Tape that comes with the protector. It works wonders for getting every little tiny speck of dust off of your phone before application. 4. And I don't know if anyone else has this problem but, have you ever noticed when using your phone on a hot summer day when your hands are kind of clammy? Lol well I have that problem and using my phone with a cheap screen protector is horrible. My fingers stick to the screen, but with Tech Armor privacy screen protectors your fingers run smooth across the screen! Even with hot clammy hands lol. And the privacy part of this protector is amazing, no more worrying about your friends or family sitting next to you being nosy trying to catch a peek of what you're doing or who you're talking to. Tech Armor merchandise gives your phone ultimate protection and for a great price! From now on, I'm definitely sticking with Tech Armor! It's worth your money and the shipping time is great too. These protectors ship straight from Tech Armor and the estimated time of delivery was 3-5 days but I received mine in less than 2 full days! One of the easiest and best purchases I've made with Amazon.com.
0.045044124000000005	0.568164	I was really looking forward to this screen protector because of the great reviews. However, when I opened the package, one of the screen protectors was ripped between the two front oval holes. At first I thought it was the design but when I looked at the remaining two there was no rip in them. That was a bit frustrating but I figured I had two more protectors. The second was a botched mess- I assume that's my fault even though I followed all the directions. SO many bubbles.But the third one worked and is sitting pretty on my phone. I'm just disappointed that I paid for three and only one worked.
0.91391075	0.81012785	This was the easiest cover I've ever applied, I got it first try and the cloth worked great to remove all dust. I've tried another matte cover but I was really unhappy with how much it degraded the screen quality, yet I liked the look and feel of the matte screen... I read a lot of good reviews on this screen so I decided to try, the price was right for 3 of them. The screen does not reduce very much quality, there is a bit but you quickly get used to it. The feel is great and reduces glare.
0.618721	0.5959675999999999	I had to use all three to finally get the screen on correctly. Kept getting dust underneath.  3rd try worked and happy with the results.
0.059392363	0.40162903	This screen feels so smooth. It's like the actual iPhone screen. I HATE the plastic screen protectors. This was worth it and lasts a long time. The only thing I hate about it is lint and junk collects around the home button and speaker.
0.9989120000000001	0.8450798	I like Tech Armor screen Protector.  I use it for my iPad, too.  This one is Matte finish so it feels good on my finger tips and wont' get any fingerprint.  It works fantastic.  I highly recommend it.
0.09395537	0.4409067	i thought this will be easy to install but it wasnt. it was hard to split the 2 plastic and used all 3 before i can finally  stick it to my phone but there were too many bubbles. not happy with this product at all
0.9988563	0.7636371	I went through two other brands of screen protectors until this one, and I must say that these are by far the easiest to install. They are very thin yet durable and works great outside in full sun! Love this product! Will purchase more for sure if needed.
0.58326495	0.59100527	i really did not like the feeling and was hoping it would go away but it didn't even after two weeks.  I tried another one and still the same thing. also when i have used other ones the little bubble would go away but with these they do not leaveupdate:Tech Armor sent me a replacement and solved the problem!!  Thank you for great costumer service
0.9919913	0.8302988000000001	Really easy to apply, no liquid solution or anything needed. Got it on easily the first try, it looks really nice, has no bubbles, and the screen still looks amazing! :)
0.16552085	0.56019306	The installation of this screen saver was so easy.  The cut was not oversized and left some wiggle room as to not cause any lifting on the sides.  It lays down real nice without all the bubbles to work out.
0.99947476	0.83588064	Great screen protector for the price, very easy to install! Highly recommended! I'll be using tech armor for all my smart phones and tablets!
0.9088744000000001	0.6644142	It takes a bit of time but if you follow instructions appropriately, there are no bubbles. I have had my fair share of screen protectors until now having owned all the iphone versions upto now and this is the best protector.From other reviews I also found that the customer service is great but did not have an opportunity to use them.One suggestion for Tech Armor would be to include one sticky sheet of paper for each screen protector in the package.
0.8118751999999999	0.7686821	Exactly what my title states. It took me seconds to install and didn't have any issues with air bubbles. The screen protector is super clear. If it wasn't for the speaker cut-out being slightly larger than the actually speaker, it would be impossible to notice you had a screen protector. Good buy, especially for the price.
0.9973059000000001	0.8174551999999999	This is an awesome pack of screen protectors.  No problems installing, and look great! Can't even tell that they are there. Recommend to anyone
0.58975667	0.7697778000000001	Easy to instal.  I am using these on 2 phones.  One of the protectors got scratched within a couple of weeks of installation.  However, the screen suffered no damage.  Even though I had to replace it within a month of use, it protected the phone - and that was the objective!
0.013882577	0.6083467	I don't know if I receive a defected product or not but when I put on it peel off after few days.  Contact seller they said will sent out our replacement first class mail about 4-5 business day.  I been waiting more than a week contact seller they asked to give them another 1-2 days.  I waited for  5 days but not thing have been sent out.  Bad customer services .  Don't buy from this seller....
0.99679625	0.7530769	Fast delivery, inexpensive, and easy to apply...just follow the instuctions! Easy to clean...you will not be disappointed! I highly recommend this protector for your iPhone 5!!!
0.9806520000000001	0.83804137	This product is just the best. Well worth the relatively high price. With its dark tint and special construction it provides true privacy without hindering the screen's brightness too much. It is quite thick and I guess the adhesive helps too,.. but this one was the easiest to install without bubbling. It also looks very neat. When the phone is off, the screen looks like a whole black area (it hides where the screen's boundaries are). It also seems to be very resilient to scratching. I like it so much,.. I recommended and bought one for my wife's iPhone 4s too.
0.46496847	0.65166533	Let the &#34;3 pack&#34; in the title not mislead you. There are only 3 front body protectors in the package. I have bought many such protectors in the last few years for all my phones and all of them included a front and a back body protector. I was surprised not to find the back protector, more so because they charge premium price for them. The same is available at almost half the price from other vendors.
0.9932232	0.83367026	This screen protector is one of the best out there. Really easy to install and absolutely no air bubbles. Stays true to its claim of being high definition.
0.9668486	0.66415244	What can be said about clear screen protectors? It works well, came quickly, serves its purpose. I would recommend. That's it!
0.9408643	0.65630627	It so clear that some time I can't tell of the protector is on my phone I had hard time  to put first 2 on but I have finally get a ride on the last one and I love  it
0.07613966	0.32995240000000003	Tried all 3 watched video on their website.....still junk I have a lot of Patience but their is a limit; could not get all the bubbles and one edge to stick properly. Followed all the instructions carefully. I will not buy TECH ARMOR and will be sure to post how I feel about this overpriced junk they sell with over 200 negative reviews there should be a recall on this product. I have bought Zagg iinvisible shield screen protector locally and are great; not fun to put on...but worth it...they cost more...you get what you pay for except TECH ARMOR!
0.4950312	0.58984506	Complete waste of money. Tried to install all three that were shipped on my new iPhone 5. Each one had bubbles,lint,etc... Bought a different product for my wife's iPhone 4s and went on easy with no problems.
0.97069067	0.65671027	My ordered shipped fast and the protector was easy to apply. I applied it perfectly the first time without bubbles! However, my tracking information never updated properly, I contacted customer service at Tech Armor and they were friendly and gave me an update.
0.8424507999999999	0.6605063	Package came in perfect condition . Only gripe I had was trying to put it on good enough so no lent or bubbles were left over.  Took me 3 tries to get it on good only thing is the edges were not as adhesive as I thought they would have been. So I have a little corner at the top that wont stay down. Other than that the look is great and did not take away from the screen resolution . Thank you
0.99966	0.88865256	"I've been buy screen protectors for iphones, iPads, and iPod touches for many years.  I thought I'd take a chance on these inexpensive items thinking.....what the heck.  Wow, these are AWESOME.  They are the perfect stiffness for going on without bubbles, and they are smooth to the touch.  Very impressed.  Been using one for a while on my iPhone 5, and recently decided to buy these for my iPads too.  Great deal.  Don't be fooled by the expensive ""name brand"" ones.  These excellent, best deal out there."
0.36268964	0.54814684	This film is INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT to install, it is ridiculous. They send you three protectors because the assumption is that you will mess up twice before you do it right the third time (which is not always the case). After a couple of mistakes and a couple of hours of labor, I could not remove all the bubbles from the screen.I have been using the phone for a few days and the screen is already scratched and showing some damage just by carrying the phone in my pocket.Not recommended.PS. After my review was read by the seller they emailed me to tell me they regret I was having problems with the product and invited me to go to their website to watch a video of how to install the screen protector. That does not help whatsoever, I tried that before they even contacted me.
0.04191956	0.4230894	missing film you remove after getting all the bubbles out.  For the price paid not sure why it didn't have two films. Will try another product next time.
0.6088686	0.64750403	There's even room for error (ex .uneven placement), for people who suck at putting on screen protectors like me :(, because the way this plastic is cut. It's a tad bit smaller so if you accidentally put it unevenly.. still looks good. at least for me.
0.99916035	0.8369373	These have done exactly what I wanted, keep fingerprints and face oils from showing. It does that surprisingly well and is very easy to clean on your sleeve if need be. Highly recommended.
0.018406271999999998	0.65328074	When I received these protectors I was excited because they got semi good reviews. However, they came bent so they do not fit nicely or stay on my phone. It keeps lifting up on the sides. My assumption is because they were bent while being shipped. They also were hard to put on and avoid bubbles. I am disappointed.
0.99550974	0.71868664	excellent product, good price best quality, strong, funcional, so easy to apply, but with extremely careful. I used two before correctly apply.
0.49135986	0.47949684	I cleaned the screen, follow the instructions and done. It took me just two minutes. Now I have to wait for its resistance after some weeks of use.
0.5130278	0.63384527	This is the best solution to the moisture trapping problem with the Otterbox defender. It keeps the phone screen and the plastic screen separated.
0.9878793	0.79161847	The protector was easy to apply with the instructions provided, just make sure the screen is completely clean and without dust particles before application. Great quality for the price paid.
0.9955027	0.8329663	Perfect Fit and feels greats, it looks good on the phone as well. Definitely and improvement over the previous clear display cover.
0.91495526	0.71644473	So far I haven't had any problems with it. The cut is pretty exact so it took a couple tries to get it aligned, but once it was on, it's worked great. The only slight concern I have is that I am using it with a Speck CandyShell Flip case and the screen protector doesn't reach all the way to the edge of the case. However, so far nothing has happened to the phone so I'm not really complaining.
0.17428094	0.47050172	At first I was annoyed that I paid $7.00 for 3 sheets (there are no back covers) of plastic. But the product works well. I am happy.
0.92232096	0.64073455	It has protected the iPhone pretty well. Would've purchase it cheaper locally but either way it works. No problem at all!
0.99866986	0.75941527	Great screen protectors and the customer service seems to be more that most companies would ever dream of providing. I have one more of my original 5 purchased 1 year ago and I hope the lifetime replacement will actually be honored when I run out of the first package. I'm very picky about how my phone looks including bubbles in the screen so I have been more than pleased and highly impressed with this product.
0.98488843	0.7998413000000001	Just got it the other day. Had it put on for free. You can do this at any cellphone stand. Inexpensive compared to other brands sold anywhere else. Couldn't ask for a better deal.
0.9921859000000001	0.66092765	I always buy this brand whenever someone in my family gets a new iphone.  Easy to apply as well!  Thanks!
0.9887511999999998	0.8444315	This super protection for my phone. The screen is not visible fingerprints. Very solid and good defense, would recommend.thank you
0.79722685	0.72371197	Nice thick screen protectors. The only thing that I would say is that it might be 100% anti-fingerprint. But other than that the quality seems great and have had the same one for a couple months now.
0.9529865	0.671764	good price and good material, but make sure no dust when put it on,no scratch so far and easy to clean
0.7267701	0.6810495	I bought the 3 pack of screen protectors for 2 iphones.The first installation worked without a hitch on the first attempt.The second iPhone resisted a clean installation despite many attempts with both of the remaining films.I finally emailed customer service to get help.They quickly sent out a replacement 3 pack and additional advice on how to do the installation.One way to avoid getting dust under the film was to install it in a humid room such as a bathroom.Finally, I was able to install on the second Iphone when the replacement screens arrived.Both iPhones are functioning well with the Tech Armor screens, but I give credit to their customer support for a good experience.
0.16610456	0.6151937	I was expecting something really cheap when I bought this. Everything it of high quality. I tried an Invisibleshield which cost $20 and it was horrible. It felt bad, looked bad, and affected picture quality. With this screen protector, you can barely tell it's on and it feels great. Plus, you get three. The dust remover stickers is a great idea and nice touch, especially at the price point!
0.9828536	0.85204375	The screen protector perfectly blocks out any glare and gives a cool gradient feeling to my phone's screen.  It feels protected from scratches, doesn't get fingerprints and does everything expected.
0.90313053	0.75656193	The screen protector is easy to put on and stays on well.  I wish that it was easier to clean because it is hard to wipe off the oils from your fingers
0.7741972	0.6830881	At first glance I thought I was purchasing a phone cover for my husband's android phone, but I found more uses for the slips than first thought.  My grand-daughter loved the ease that it covered her iPhone and it was a life saver for my xm radio in the car.
0.73600674	0.40886205	Ive been avoiding tech armor i dont know why but i regret it because they are great protect, its invisible!
0.9927251	0.7764833000000001	Exactly what is says! works great for my phone and is just what i was looking for in a cover!
0.78588486	0.7450032	I'm glad this was a three pack. My excitement overcame my direction following and I neglected the dust removing sticker on the first two attempts. Third try in a well lit, recently steamy bathroom, keeping the dust out of the air, I applied the screen bubble free. I also found starting at the home button end made it easier to line it up correctly.
0.9849174	0.91758096	"I've used Tech Armor Anti-Glare protectors on most of my electronics that need protectors. I've got them on my IPOD, my IPAD, and both my daughter and my IPhone's. What we've found is that they are, consistently, easy to apply if you follow directions. They look nice and they fit the product well. There are not any ""corner"" bubbles or pieces that stick out (like there are on other protectors) and the glare reduction on this particular one works fabulously without sacrificing any visual elements.Since I am a handheld video gamer I have tons of handheld units so have been putting protectors on for many years. The best way for me is to clean the top of the device, leave the cloth on top, and place it on a counter (I usually put something underneath it). Then I lift the cloth off and quickly position the screen at one side of the unit (per instructions). I pull off the tab and peel back a TINY bit and then lay it down - almost to where it doesn't stick as there is not enough contact. Then I slowly, while using a credit card (not the card they send you in the package...that's kind of useless to me) peel and slide the credit card at the same time. At no time does the peel go further than the credit card so basically there is almost no air getting underneath. As long as your hand is steady and you position it so it is straight this should work. No bubbles at all on this one and it lines up perfectly. Voila!"
0.9861094000000001	0.659949	Normally I would have gotten the matte, but with the clarity of the iphone 5 I wanted to try and be able to enjoy it. The clear is great. I still do prefer the matte -- but these work just fine.The price is GREAT. They come in a set of 3. They also include cleaning supplies and very good directions. I have zero complaints.Thanks!
0.79027224	0.71384835	I've used very nice screen protectors and some really cheap ones. These fall somewhere in the middle.The nice type I've used before are from bestskinsever.com but due some recent changes they made to the front protector (added hole for light sensor on iphone4 causing it to get junk caught under it). So, after getting a new iPhone 5 I decided to try these due to the life time warranty.I've been happy with the for 4 weeks of use.I installed one super easily. I think it was mostly luck on my part as I lined up the bottom and the top holes all lined perfectly. I do have some experience and I don't think it was anything special about the product but I was very happy with installation.Pros:--Study design (feel thick enough to take a blow)--Nice feel and not too tacky--Good Fit--Doesn't distort image (screen is clear HD)Cons:--finger prints cling to it (can be easily wiped away but still annoying)Not sure about longevity yet but overall I'm very happy. If not for the finger prints I'd get 5 stars.
0.9939101	0.74844104	What can i say... thats what you look for on this things.. its a perfect fit! feels great on the touch. Packaging its great.. it brings de little cloth and the card to apply. Overall 10.
0.95251095	0.8523350000000001	The best thing about this shield is you almost can't tell it's there.Application is relatively easy, although I added the extra precaution of using a can of compressed air to clear a few pieces of lint which appeared after the polishing with the cleaning cloth.  The initial lining up of the protector/mask with the phone took multiple attempts since the screen leaves slightly less than 1 mm of clearance on all sides and being off a little could result in the protector overlapping one side and not fully covering the other.  Still, with the assistance of the video instruction on Tech Armor's website, I was able to get the button and protector lined up at the bottom without completely removing the sticker completely and didn't waste a single screen protector.I have observed absolutely no loss in touch sensitivity or phone or app operation, and the separate streamlined protective case fits the phone and screen protector perfectly.  I'm very satisfied with this product.
0.46939284	0.5814236999999999	Had ordered this in April and was able to easily install the protector following the Instructions recommended from Tech Armor's website. I usually don't like using screen protectors because of hating the screen losing detail, but this protector looks and feels like nothing is even there.Unfortunately my protector had gotten damaged and needed to replaced. The extra 2 protectors didn't go on as smoothly and ended up getting bubbles and dust under. This is all most likely do to user error.All in all, I will be purchasing this product again as it is really worth the money.
0.110274404	0.38141418	It's very hard to get the air bubbles out. And the card is really not that much either to make them go away.
0.061842978	0.41633824	This product does what it says it will do. I can not think of a better recommendation for a protection product.
0.8208184000000001	0.7521253999999999	Packet  came on time.Screen protector for my iPhone was very easy to install, there were no bubbles , very smooth, clean and clearIt does not effect sensitivity of the screen if you use finger or pen.I would recommend this product. But one should always shop first, there is always a better deal and product.
0.02613759	0.35065165	Kill the HD sense ...  after put this on, everything looks so Slurred  Slurred Slurred Slurred Slurred Slurred&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;  cant bear with only for one min...  take it off and through into trash can !!do NOT BUY!!!
0.93491066	0.8379073	Realized my earrings were scratching my screen when I talked on the phone. Decided on the matte/anti-glare/anti-fingerprint one. Came with 3 and cleaning cloth and squeegee. Read and watched the instructional video before starting. My husband and I each used one and have one left. It took him one try and one minute to put on and it looks great. Mine was a little off center so I tried to re-adjust but everytime I peel it back up to re-adjust, dust gets in. So, I think it's best to just leave it after the first attempt. The holes still align and works so I try to not let it bother me and it hasn't. Love the anti-glare and it is anti-fingerprint but it does make the images appear a bit grainy and not as clear and bright but that doesn't bother me. It's been a week and stays on great, hasn't peeled. Highly recommend.
0.7417658	0.7536541999999999	Great screen protector!! You cannot even notice it on the screen!  It does not decrease the responsiveness of the phone with tapping.  Has protected the screen from scratches!  Price is spot-on too.The only thing in applying it: Be sure to pay attention to the stickers -- one side has a little 1, the other has a 2.  This is the order in which you should remove the plastic.  I didn't really pay attention at first because the numbers were not very noticeable and the stickers looked identical at first glance.... then ended up with a very sticky side facing up (and had to discard this one).
0.69594693	0.7892482	This was easy to apply (though be very careful of dust getting caught under there. If this happens try getting it off with tape) and the privacy screen works great! Unless someone is looking directly over my shoulder the screen is too blurred to see clearly
0.93445647	0.7669405	It does what it advertises. It provides privacy and security. What i really love is that the scree looks clean, because it doesn't show your fingertips on the screen. The only minus is that the screen looks a little bit darker and has a weird hue. But you can live with that.Great product!
0.9047480999999999	0.7153427	This is the third pack of these I have ordered and I could not be more happy. They are easy to apply--just follow the instructions--maintain the proper feel of the screen, and are very durable.  The reason I have ordered three packs of these is because I give them to friends and family who keep buying the $20 single packs of some other brand which are nowhere this good.  I don't even look at the other options on amazon; these are it.
0.55268055	0.5727161000000001	I bought a Gadget Guard screen protector for my iPhone 5 few months ago. It was pretty expensive ($20 with shipment) and it contained only 1 protector! It didn't work even a month for me. It started bubbling up at the corners because of the bumper that I use. So I ended up ordering this screen protector. Last night I received them. I removed my old screen protector and was shocked because the glue remained on the screen. I tried alcohol and nail polish remover to clean it, but didn't work. Finally I tried my oily make up remover and surprisingly it removed the glue perfectly (I thought it's better to share my experience :)). it took me just few seconds to place the Tech Armor protector on the screen and it sat so amazingly on the screen. It's super clear and I ended up installing it with no bubbles. When I put the bumper case back, it didn't remove the protector. So now I am happy with my phone and I'm glad I have 2 more screen protectors to replace later :)
0.99575174	0.6260283	Very good purchase! I am very satisfied with this purchase and I strongly recommend it to all customers. You will Love it.
0.98669004	0.7051685000000001	This protector is great - you can't even tell it's on there. Amazing company, they definitely mean it when it comes to their warranty!
0.6485293000000001	0.7707759	We use this with an Otterbox Commuter Case and it works great.  The case fit a little tight right around the edges of the screen protector and lifted the edges a little creating a bubble, but that is more an issue with the case than the screen protector.  He puts it through a lot and it has stayed on with no issues.  It does have a tiny tear in the middle of the screen from car keys (after two months of use), but the screen was not compromised.
0.9914974	0.765145	This is a great screen protector. I watched the instruction video before hand, buy I feel that even if I had not watched it, the process would have been just as easy! There are no air bubble at all. I also love the matte feel to the screen.I will definitely continue to order my screen protectors from Tech Armor. My order also arrived the day after I placed it'
0.042082667000000004	0.45477349999999994	These Tech Armor HD screen protectors won top choice because of all the positive reviews, but we've been sorely disappointed. The screens claim to be HD but they smudge and stay dirty. The first time applying one it went on crooked. When we tried to fix it we ended up with dust and spots all over, and we haven't been able to get it right. We ordered Zagg protectors today to replace these, because the Zagg protectors were great on our previous phones. I would return these if we could.
0.9305698	0.65560424	I've only been using it for a few weeks and haven't dropped my phone yet, but so far I'm happy with this screen protector. I forget that it's there- there is no glare and there are no air bubbles.
0.99653494	0.8222507	This product was just like describe by the company and it was a great product for the price. I would recommend this durable privacy screen to anyone because it is a great product for a low price.
0.72569424	0.5592716999999999	Allow for good vision of the display. Very good fit. If only I could figure out how to put these things on like the dust free videos
0.99706435	0.7296268	Awesome product for the price. Don't hesitate if you are on the fence about ordering. I forget that I even have it on my screen.
0.8773076	0.72815526	it fit on my phone great, and went on extremely easy! no bubbles or anything. i would definitely buy it again but i probably won't have to since it came with i think 2 or 3 in the package
0.3709963	0.5005727	I watched the video online and studied the directions many times before attempting to place the protector on my phone. The hardest part is lining up the protector. The first two times the little hole for the camera would be aligned. The third time it wasn't perfect, but better than the other times. I wish I would have just spent the extra money and got it professionally placed on my phone since I pretty much wasted three protectors.
0.3975492	0.6441996	After going through several screen protectors with privacy, most had only 2-way privacy or were not cut to the right dimensions of iPhone 5. This had both and quality was very good too
0.9852404	0.78614175	This is a great screen cover. It is easy to install, especially compared to competitor products.It has been in use for 2 months and so far no scratches
0.9866345999999999	0.78854823	Gives you feeling of a paper and also reduces the extra brightness in order to give a smooth feeling to your eyes. Go for  it.it worth every penny.
0.9632729999999999	0.8073686	Goes on easily and is completely clear after about 48 hours. The bubbles disappear after about a day, and the screen protector seems to resist finger prints better than the iPhone screens oleo phobic coating.  I am very pleased with the product.
0.9951419	0.8155679	The best screen protector I have ever had! It is really true touch and crystal clear as it was said. Besides the excellent product, The incredible service from Tech Armor is hard to find one now a day!
0.46342534	0.4582028	Pretty good. Not too bad. They're useable and will get the job done. Doesn't come with back though so double check first.
0.9982578999999999	0.8250468000000001	Easy to install!  Love the matte finish on the protector.  No glare and love the feel of it.  Would definitely recommend them.
0.9158461999999999	0.6655926999999999	I wolud just says this screen proctetor with 3-pack is a good deal and the product qality is good.I used it from 2 of my iphone 5 its been month now ...no issues
0.14856392	0.30362236	Try as I may, I cannot get the bubbles out of it. Not good. I will need to get a new screen protector .
0.9826290999999999	0.75572634	The Tech Armor screen saver that I ordered was just as advertised. It fit my iPhone 5 perfectly. This item was delivered promptly.
0.9989318000000001	0.7033136999999999	Quick delivery, great purchase, highly recommend it. In the future i will definitely buy this product again for any other phone or electronic needs.
0.97450197	0.84546834	I feel like my phone is much more protected and it cuts some glare. I will say that through polarized sun glasses it make my phone an odd color, I usually take them off to use my phone. It also helps reduce the look of fingerprints all over, which I feel helps protect my password.
0.96317387	0.67506	I bought these when I bought my new iPhone. I am still using the first screen protector, and I probably won't need to replace it anytime soon. A great deal!
0.9980716999999999	0.821627	This privacy screen is so great! I get so many comments from people about how impressed they are with how well it works. I actually prefer the feel of this screen to other screen protectors out there as well. Tech Armor was very timely with their shipping and I will definitely consider them for future purchases.
0.9981890999999999	0.756417	these are great! i love them so much they are perfect for my phone and i can see it even outside
0.99213463	0.7570551	It's your typical screen protector - it goes on easy and got here quick. They also came with a nice screen cleaner, which was nice.
0.7874024000000001	0.7722839	I usually end up wasting money when I buy screen protectors - I either leave pockets of air that wont go away or there are pieces of lint that my OCD will not accept. So i end up removing the protector and throwing it away.The Tech armor 4-way privacy screen protector was super easy to apply and no air bubbles! Just clean your screen with the included cloth and lint tape and the screen protector pretty much applies itself.It does dim the screen slightly and makes it slightly grainy, but its not a big deal at all. I actually like it and It feels great to the touch!
0.6787732	0.67574215	I'm still on my first protector, it has a few little scratches on it and an air bubble at the bottom seam that just wont go away but over all I like these.  They were not to expensive, came with three and are pretty durable!
0.9881691999999999	0.705971	I really liked this screen protector, it was easy to put on and I liked that it came with multiple things to clean your screen with. I was very pleased!
0.076428235	0.5212544	This has got to be the worst screen protector I've ever used. I went through 2 out of the 3 putting it on and it has sooo many bubbles even after I followed the directions perfectly. Plus, they came with little sticker tabs on it and when you peel it off.. it leaves the sticky residue! I had to use alcohol on a cotton ball to get the stickiness off.
0.8684174000000001	0.7298126	I ordered my screen protectors back in April and I've used two since. One of them got a little scratch and it was bothering me, but I just changed it! It protects the screen like it says and gives it a nice matte look. No more sun glare when you're outside. The only problem I do have with it though is that it dos get scratched quite easily if you're not careful.
0.9883460999999999	0.8355520000000001	It fits perfectly and was very easy to install. It looks nice and the matte finish doesn't let fingerprints show so I don't have to constantly clean the screen.
0.98794436	0.77964413	This screen protector has been great.  There is a natural feel to the screen and it was relatively easy to place on the phone.  No issues.
0.9146688000000001	0.64923054	I really like the matte screen protector - there's no glare when I'm outside which is nice. The screen protectors shipped very quickly.  I will be ordering more when I use the three that came in the package.
0.14050436	0.25262588	Wouldn't even know it was there!! I hope this is the last time I'll need to buy a screen protector!
0.9932636	0.7777107	must have. i work outdoors and this protects my screen from dust. one goes a long way. worth every penny
0.6520633000000001	0.5659890000000001	If you can put them on yourself without any issues, they are prefectly fine.  Would definately order more when the time warrents.
0.84805745	0.69547445	I really love this brand and usually never disappoint but this time around it didn't live up my expectations. I had scratches l. The screen protector, it was surprisingly difficult to put on, and there was dust already on the cover.
0.96321213	0.7726397	this product does exactly what it says it does.....anti-glare and anti-fingerprint!!!! i would certainly recommend it to all my friends.
0.98464257	0.8455360999999999	So far, these are working well. Installation was easy; I saw a suggestion to do it in a humid room, so I went into the bathroom and turned the shower on for about 3 minutes, then used that as my room. No bubbles or any other issues, the protector disappeared onto the screen and stayed there. It has been on for quite a while now with no sign of coming off. Only issue is I don't recall where I put the extras!
0.9614196	0.8127835999999999	This screen protector has a perfect cut , stays where it should no loose corners or edges.The Matt finish looks awesome .
0.7342526	0.6701772	I must admit that I enjoy my privacy when I am on my phone!  Whether it is from browsing, playing games, and especially texting...Tech Armor has designed such a great product that gets the job done!  It does not take away from the purposes of using the phone although to some people may not like it because they don't want to see the fibers from the screen protector and rather see clarity of the HD experience.  I know that Tech Armor will udpate their product later to see if they can make a privacy screen that is more compatible of allowing HD clarity through without giving up the security, but until then...I enjoy this product!  I'd rather use this than the zaggs product because of cost and I know that in the past with some zaggs products there is wet application and water and electronics do not mix!If you are in the market of looking for a cost efficient privacy protector, this is the product for you!
0.011233449	0.6073666	The sticker marked 2 is very hard to be removed. It left the glue on the tech armor screen. I have to use 3rd party product to get rid of the glue. I tried 2 screens thinking the 1st one was defect, 2nd one is the same. the sticker left the glue making the screen sticky.
0.0063910782	0.6299108	I got my package which looks like it had been kicked around, and then when I attempted to use it as per the instructions, the top spring loaded hatch broke away from the spring mechanism and now doesn't function. Very disappointed
0.9236573	0.5660681	Ever since I put it on I forget that I even have a screen protector on, it's that clear. I haven't dropped or scratched my phone as yet so I don't know how it holds up to those kind of conditions but it works. I do notice that there is more smudging on my screen but it's no big deal. It's cheap and I feel more secure with it on.
0.9992466999999998	0.84468937	Fits very well and has worked great. Would definitely recommend. Easy to install, had no problems and the price is very reasonable.
0.84328616	0.7349061	I buy tons of accessories, tons....These protectors were easy to apply, no bubbles if done from bottom to top..Start by lining up home button and don't put on protector flat...bend it as you apply from the bottom up..if any bubbles appear, pull back a bit and put back on...works like a charm....Fingerprints do slightly show however, not a lot...not while you're using it, just when screen is off.
0.8112600999999999	0.6790046	I found this to be a decent screen protector for the price.One thing I noticed is that holes on the screen protector are not aligned very well with the iPhone-5.i.e. if you get the lower part (around the home button) aligned correctly, the upper part (around the front-facing camera) is no longer aligned. So far this has only been a minor inconvenience, since the screen protector is not blocking the camera.I would give this 4 stars, especially given the price.
0.9304893	0.68380725	I had a little trouble with the first one, but the second went on perfectly!  I guess that's why they come in a three pack.  I've still got an extra and a perfectly installed screen protector.
0.96540666	0.6837585999999999	I'm enjoying this screen protector. Unlike my other screen protectors I use to see my finger prints and scratches. Not on this one. It's smooth. Shipping was fast. I would totally buy this again. But don't think I'll have to cause the quality feels like its gonna last me a lifetime.
0.8984955	0.72066534	I received my screen protector within two days of ordering it and it does exactly what I want it to.  It blocks out the screen for anyone but me looking at it and it doesn't take away from the clearness of the screen at all.  I had my friend put the screen on for me because I usually have problems installing screen protectors.  He misallign the top right corner so it bubbled up and doesn't stick down.  I contacted Tech Armor support and they sent me a new one no questions asked.  I couldn't be more happy with the product and the service.  Great company and the lifetime warranty isn't a joke.  100% satisfied
0.9193094999999999	0.65828645	It's a challenge to apply; that's for sure. If you cannot hang wallpaper, you might try to get someone who can to help you apply the sheet. The struggle is definitely worth it. This is an excellent product to reduce--nearly eliminate--glare. For the price, you really cannot go wrong.
0.9928011999999998	0.74183357	Just purchased and recieved this product in the mail so no problems thus far. Lifetime warranty is a great safety net.
0.69047844	0.72013295	Like probably many of you I've had varied success with phone screen protectors.  Even some of the more expensive ones with the wet application didn't work out all that effectively for me.  No matter how cautious, in the end I always ended up with the bubble at the most annoying spot or the edge that always curled.  But with Tech Armor because of its slightly thicker and firmer film, putting it on was, relative to other protectors, a cinch.  And no bubbles, no finger prints, and it looks good.And for me, the anti-glare was effective. I would not have been able to watch videos outdoors in the sun without it.  Of course you still have to angle the phone away from the sun--there's no way to avoid the reflection if you face it directly towards the sun.My only regret is that the film does obscure the retina display, but I knew it would and prefer the protection and anti-glare features that this protector affords.
0.99753344	0.83864087	The screen is clear, and sticks well. Would buy again. Easy installation, good protection for the iphone screen, it also fit perfect.
0.990072	0.8312925999999999	this screen protector was very easy to line up and apply without bubbles and it's stuck on well for the past month without any scratches or anything. i love the matte look and the anti-glare is great for using the phone outside.
0.9648495	0.6501781999999999	We had some issues with the first set but I emailed Tech Armor and they were great. They took care of the problem fast. I will order from them in the future.
0.9138313	0.69510156	Works great, and I have no complaints, except that it's a bit of a pain to put on.  You can't even tell it's there.  So far it's done it's job well, though I've only had it for about 2 months.  Seems to be doing it's job pretty well, especially considering we didn't have to pay the apple price tag :-)
0.9479771	0.780949	Fits fine on black iPhone5. Only criticism is that the cut-outs for the front facing camera and the speaker are wider than required on the left side giving a funny look. Otherwise functional and prompt shipping. Will purchase again from TechArmor, but would love to see the cut-outs shortened and aligning with iPhone5.
0.25657517	0.7641469	The primary up side of Tech Armor, after three experiences with them, is that if you can't get the screen protector on your phone straight, they are prompt and willing to provide replacements.I also like the glare-proof quality of the matte screen protector for the Iphone. It doesn't get all streaky with fingerprints, either.The (slight) down side -- perhaps of all screen protectors -- is that they are really hard to get into position without a few tries, so I wind up without a backup for future use. But based on my experience with them, Tech Armor will come through with a replacement pack if this happens to you.Suggestion to Tech Armor: I think the positioning of the paper tabs is a boondoggle that you should look into. The relationship of the tabs to the design holes on the screen protector is the key to getting it in position, and when the tabs are on the same end as the major holes, you can't line the thing up properly to guarantee the positioning line will be accurate when you drop the plastic sheet into place on the face of the phone.
0.9921174	0.8099997	This product is great... even when I trapped a few bubbles I was able to smooth them out with a little patience.  I love the feel, it really is true to the feel of the screen.
0.44599724	0.54674363	I luv this screen no one can see what I'm doing on my phone now when looking from the sides ! Buy buy buy buy you will luv it ! I luv the privacy
0.95996976	0.82607234	I received the screen protector very quickly. I was anxious to try it out. The instructions that came with it were very easy to read and understand. I was able to place the screen protector on the phone without any problems and only had one bubble that was easy to remove. After I put it on the phone it was impossible to tell that there was anything on the screen. I was surprised how easy it went on since my previous tries with my old phone the screen protector was hard to place and have it stay in place (this was another product). I would definitely buy this again and will recommend it to my friends!
0.9667462	0.85230476	The purchase process was easy, the shipping was fast and the price was very fair. I had a little trouble applying the first one because I didn't have it lined up correctly then i got a little lint underneath. l peel it off and applied another one of the three that came in the package and did it perfectly. Had I first followed the tips and read the full instructions I wouldn't have had issue... Shame on me for being a man. Read the extra install instuctions on the website and you will find that the install process is easy. I am really impressed with the quality of the screen protector and I barely know it is even on. I've tried other brands of screen protectors in the past and they obscured the viewing quality of my phone, so I always ended up removing them and going commando. This screen protector has none of those image quality issues and I will no need to go commando any longer. I will continue to purchase Tech Armor brand when next needed.
0.9906454	0.74303526	This was so easy to apply to the Iphone.  I've used this product on other phones and I thinks its great!
0.8504347	0.63117635	Guess it's a good screen protector and it came with a cleaning cloth, etc.What I don't like is that it seems to smudge much easier than the screen protector I had on my previous iPhone.
0.9939834999999999	0.78864014	Did exactly what it said it would and the application process was easy! I recommend this for anyone looking for a simple screen protector!
0.46907187	0.6560074	Works as described but mine came without part 2 (remove the top cover which it never had). Also after 3-4 months I noticed it starting to peel so personally going back to the budget ones from eBay. Feels good knowing it's blocking the blue light but didn't notice anything change with sleep because of this fact.
0.28262728	0.45127016	I had to use 2 out of the 3 covers just to get it somewhat acceptable, but there are still bubbles.  The supplied &#34;squeegee&#34; did not help much.  I may have to use the 3rd. one, so overall, it was not a good value.
0.5608579	0.60812813	This Armor-tech screen product is amazing and the price can't be beat.  I had returned the &#34;Invisi-shield&#34; which everyone raved about and was $29.99 at Sprint since it kept coming off.  I also returned the Power Support HD Anti-Glare Films for New iPhone 5 sold by Apple store. Same issues and fit was poor.This Armor-tech product works really well and does not interfere with the case I have on - SF Matte Black - Apple iPhone 5 Ringke SLIM SF Premium Hard Case by Rearth, and also the Seidio CSR3IPH5-GR Surface Case for Apple iPhone 5 case. The screen is slightly dulling due to the anti-glare which I am OK with since I don't use my phone to watch videos.  There is no loss of imagery with the screen on and still very sensitive to touch.The application of the Armor-tech product was so easy... no sweat.  Went on immediately and was on really good with no need to push out any bubbles.  The protector comes with only one lining and not the top lining as stated in the product description.  However, I was lucky that the screen protector had no scratches on them so I was OK without having the protection layer on top of the actual plastic film.The lifetime warranty is a great thing although I don't think I will go through the 3 that came in package any day soon.
0.8839427	0.685377	it compares to the $60 ones they sale in the stores as long as you know how to put them on.  there were a little more air bubbles but just keep using the cardboard they included and smoothing it out
0.9955424	0.6749046	I heard about this through a friend and thought it was so cool! I had to get one! It is awesome! I love it! Well worth the money!
0.99913883	0.8400247999999999	These are super easy to install and I love the matte finish.  Fingerprints hardly show at all and it is so easy to see the screen outside - especially important with the summer sun heading our way.  Highly recommend!
0.92271805	0.73832214	This screen protector is great! A little tricky to put on, but not rocket science. There may be a few air bubbles at first that will probably work their way out in a few hours.
0.07331124	0.4555267	I received the product today. Was pretty disappointed to see that the screen protector itself had scratches. Aha but I have 3 of those, so let me check one of the other two! Turns out all of them have scratches!Did not like the empty notch below the home button. A circle cut for the home button would have been better. Sure it would have taken more precision cutting on behalf of the manufacturer.overall big disappointment
0.046839505	0.48992768	If you have your brightness all the way up it doesn't really have the privacy effect ! Also you can see like little colorful pixels under it , it doesn't keep your screen hd clear. May be taking mine off soon , was a waste of money to me
0.43613765	0.66342235	First screen I have tried that went on the first try.  No bubbles. And the tabs actually pulled the shipping sheets off without hassle.  Did I mention no bubbles? And it looks like nothing is there.  I am picky about this, and truly inept, so you can buy this with confidence.
0.15826622	0.5028714	The screen protector itself is fine. But the instructions toput it on the phone wasn't quite clear and easy. I wasted two pieces, and finally got the third one on the right way.
0.99046624	0.87036216	This is a very effective product. It is sized perfectly to cover the entire screen. Some screen protectors seem to be slightly undersized to make it easier to apply. A side effect of this is less than ample coverage.It effectively reduces glare and makes fingerprints non existent.
0.93931353	0.7359074000000001	works good , does the job nd protects the screen and no one can see your screen from the sides.
0.95675063	0.7160747	A good deal for the price that it asks for. It was much more easy to use than what I thought it would be, came up without any bubbles. Just follow the instructions and start pasting in bottom-to-top manner.
0.9978206000000001	0.8067466	Fairly easy to install with the instructions, no bubbles.  Excellent matte finish, would definitely recommend this product for those who like a little antiglare than the polished glass
0.42032829999999993	0.60382944	My only gripe with this version of the product is that it is a &#34;fingerprint-magnet&#34;. However, a handkerchief or paper towel is enough to clean it.
0.057136476	0.4527452	I did not like this product at all. Although it proves to be anti glare n anti finger print, the display gets blurry. This makes the sharp display to be blurred with reading smaller fonts harder.
0.95874953	0.7683493	It was a breeze installing this screen protector. I went though the video mentioned on the paper provided along with the product. Hope it stays on :) !!
0.98189217	0.7679275	It was easy to install per the instructions provided with out a single bubble. I would surely recommend this  product.
0.997532	0.8410759	I love the screen protectors from tech armor. I am not quite the best with IPhones and the screens and these are very helpful. Also it helps keep the smudges and everything off my phone
0.9981283999999999	0.78999937	LOVE these!! I highly doubt that I'll ever go back to the regular clear ones! I love how my fingerprints are no longer all over the place!
0.99253774	0.75938463	Bought this for my new iPhone 5.  I really like the anti-glare feature.  Your fingers glide across the screen.  Great product.
0.97259265	0.7865956999999999	Product is great for protecting the screen of my new iPhone. It is also a good product to use when compared with others as it reduces the glare on your screen.
0.7946175	0.6842136999999999	Received within a week. Easy to apply on my iPhone 5 on my first try without any bubbles. I bought the HD clear one and i noticed fingerprint easily left on the screen, so maybe should have bought anti fingerprint/anti-glare, but overall I am satisfied.
0.9825984	0.8605748	This goes on very easily.  Video is helpful too if you haven't ever put one on.  Didn't get hardly any bubbles and was able to get a couple specks of dust out with the included tape.  Feels great to the touch, very clear, and accurate.  Like it much better than the matte finish.
0.012868196	0.5521499	All 3 of the screen protectors were missing the 2nd sticker needed to pull off the 2nd screen after installation, waste of $6
0.9942854	0.8172403	Goes on easily and is a great bargain for the price.  It also wipes clean very easily.  A great product for the price.
0.47262385	0.5327192	i like the anti-fngerprint screen protector. it's really good enough for my iphone. after using it, my phone shows more clearly now.
0.9942448	0.7992463000000001	Easy to use, no bubbles, worked perfect! Had no problems at all! Also, they came in within a reasonable time.
0.98243177	0.8004523	Works great. I've had the screen on my phone for a couple of days now and I have no complaints. I really like the matte feel and that it doesn't get dirty with fingerprints.
0.97867507	0.8067795	My problem with screen protectors is they are sometimes difficult to put on with out getting bubbles.  This one was very easy and works perfectly on my iPhone5.
0.9671847	0.8246062	Rather than usually buying cheap screen protectors I decided to go for something more premium and it was well worth it.It's quite smooth and durable. Cutouts are very precise. Messed up 2 before I got it on nicely without any dust or bubbles.Hint: Use scotch tape to remove visible dust. Don't over do it else it'll attract more dust inside.
0.9398433	0.7732295	Very Good quality. comes with things to clean and apply. It is not easy to align. Had to remove couple of times before getting it right.
0.99224025	0.72605217	The screen protector fits the iPhone5 very well.  It was a challenge getting it on the first time but if you follow the instructions provided it makes it much easier to apply.  So make sure to follow the directions.  Great buy for the price and it arrived ahead of the scheduled delivery.
0.9816431999999999	0.834089	I've never left a review on Amazon, but for this product I have to. This is the best screen protector I have used on any phone. It doesn't feel *exactly* like the iPhone screen, which is expected, but it's not annoyingly noticeable. It's also slim without being thin and not protective. My phone looks great and the picture is unaltered. I couldn't ask for anything more in a screen protector!Also, I have to mention that I love the special tape they added to take away the dust off your screen before you apply the protector. It's a little detail that makes all the difference.Update: After a couple minutes of usage the screen protector actually feels exactly like the iPhone screen.
0.9918959999999999	0.80566126	This product is great!! It really protects the phone screen and it does prevent glare and fingerprinting. I would recommend it.
0.99425256	0.6845468000000001	I love this product.Easy to install and quality is superior.I have wasted one of the protector due to wrong installation, my mistake.I highly recommend this product.
0.9872025	0.8064736	Just take care and your time in putting these on and they are great. No bubbles, alligned almost perfect, and still looks good after a couple of months.
0.7866969	0.6077665	Fit the screen very well, with the top part not exactly centered but good enough.  It is matte and u don't see any fingerprints or glare.  I didn't realize it was matte and that it would take away some from the loom of the hd retina screen, so if u don't mind that its a good screen cover
0.14401865	0.51475024	Although this product is matte, it ruins the display on the iphone. The colors aren't vibrant and beautiful as should be when screen protector is on.
0.9263556999999999	0.7521912	Once I got it in the mail, I opened the packaged and rushed to replaced my screen protector! I didn't even read any instructions but I got it on the right way with so little air bubbles. It was aligned closed to perfect, if not perfect, and it was pretty easy to get air bubbles out. Also, I love how it feels but it kind of affects the sharpness of the colors. I really don't care. Oh and no fingerprints!!! AND EASY TO READ IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA!
0.9490261000000001	0.78946966	Easy to apply, and it has 3 screens so if you mess up, you can restart! There's little loss of HD quality and the texture of the material reminds me of holding a matte photograph&#8212;truly fantastic.
0.9465891	0.7151999	Was able to get it on first try. still able to move it around once it was down.  very good introductions  Cant even tell its on the phone. first time i ever able to get one on without using all 3.
0.9974586999999999	0.7986201	So I just installed the screen protector a few hours ago and haven't looked back since! I had no hesitation in buying a Tech Armor product because I know they really do produce premium items along with providing excellent customer service.I have had bad experiences with installing screen protectors in the past, but I just read the 4 simple steps and watched the video on their website 3 times. I then followed the video step-by-step as I installed my screen protector. It went on absolutely flawless; I was so amazed!I would definitely recommend these screen protectors to anyone who is in the market for one. Even if you think you won't ever need one because you don't think you'll ding your screen at all, it cannot hurt. Also, with a product like Tech Armor's, it doesn't even feel like you have a screen protector installed!Look no further for a screen protector. This is the best price you can find for the top-notch quality you'll receive. Love it!
0.62323344	0.5105847	Good in general, good fit but not perfect, good assistance in the web site for installation. Does not reduce the display definition.
0.9747515	0.8034300999999999	Absolutely great product, applied smoothly with no hassle on the first try. EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED! Don't think twice about buying these screen protectors.
0.4190066	0.5168674	I really like how the screen protector does not show up all the fingerprints and smudge marks.  I like the matte finish, too.  it does make it even more difficult to see the screen when I'm outside in the bright daylight. Therefore, only 4 stars.
0.2556035	0.33099958	I only received on screen protector. I messed up putting the first one on so I was like okay I have 2 more.... nope, you only get one!
0.9856303	0.79846036	Great for the price. Love the matte feel and finish. Don't get anymore glossy reflections. Nice warranty and you get 3 in the package.
0.07347515	0.39695916	Phone case was not fit tight to the phone and honestly looked no better than cheaper screens. I would look for cheaper ones.
0.9963207000000001	0.73329	Three screen protectors for a very cheap price when comparing it to those you buy in stores such as Best Buy. Definitely recommended to friends and family members. Only thing about this product is that it requires a steady hand, or you have a chance like messing up like I did! Hangs off a little bit, but I can live with it coming up a little! Again, an amazing investment!
0.9219662000000001	0.6430011	Came as expected and if you mess up you can try again. I like this product especially for the price
0.014598696999999999	0.45396802	Garbage. They come off in my pockets. Bubbles on the screen.
0.18428347	0.5021215	I bought this screen protector for my black iphone5, when I saw the screen protector ,when I finish I just curious&#8220;Why is this hole is to the left of the screen protector's middle,is there so hard to make it in the middle?&#8221;Then I sent a e-mail to Tech Armor customer service,told them the hole is not in the middle and also told them I feel the glare problem is too obvious.Hours later,I got a reply,the Customer support team explain very carefully to let me know the reason why the hole to the left is to leave spaces for two sensors so the two sensors can perform normally.And they want me 100% satisfy that they were very glad to sent me a replacement pack of 3 Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors at no cost to me.And I received the replacement pack promptly.I was so exciting about the amazing warranty, sadly there is another pack of 3 HD Screen Protectors but not  a replacement pack of Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors. Then I mail them again and told them this situation&#65292;you can't believe what had happened&#65292;they would like give me  another replacement pack of 3 Anti-Fingerprint/Anti-Glare screen protectors at no cost to me&#65292;This is crazy , although I feel upset with the wrong sending mistake&#65292;but their positive action just cheer me up .I love Tech Armor! It should be your first choice.If you choose Tech Armor!You'd got better manufacture and the best customer service!
0.90851647	0.8259163	I have always thought screen protectors were kinda lame. They always seem to fit and look bad and detract from the beauty of the iPhone. Plus I haven't really ever scratched my phone so I wasn't too worried about it.That is until I started to get really annoyed with all the fingerprints and &#34;greasy&#34; look on the screen. I would clean the screen and almost immediately it would look terrible again.The Tech Armor screen protector has a matte finish so you don't retain any finger prints and it has a nice texture to it. The anti-glare seems to be helpful too when using the phone out doors.This is a great value and with the 3 pack, it should easily last the life of the phone. The application was super easy and the tech armor demo video definitely helped.
0.9878273999999999	0.77011114	I have always used Tech Armor products for my Iphone 5, i originally bought the clear protector which was a good product. However I tend to get sweaty hands when I use my phone for an extended period of time. So i started to look at the Anti-Fingerprint Screen protectors. So i bought this and received it in about a week and then followed the instructions and was able to have a perfect installation with this product. After the installation i noticed and huge difference in the feel of the two products it is nice and smooth and my fingers glade with ease over my screen. i am very happy with my purchase!
0.23676997	0.48143607	I've always had a protective screen on my iPhone and I feel like they do their job in protecting the screen.  This is no different.  Although it seems like it's impossible to get zero air bubbles or trapped dust particles.  However, I did better this time around.
0.90000665	0.79045486	Package included a card to push out bubbles, cleaning cloth, 3 screen protectors and tape to remove dust off the phone's screen. I was able to install the protector with the first try. This HD really lives up to it's name. The clarity of the iphone 5's screen seems completely uncompromised with the screen protector on it. Would recommend this screen protector to anyone and the fact that there's 3 is pretty awesome in case you mess up installing the first time, or you need them to replace one that gets damaged.
0.99897355	0.7605062	These are awesome. It took me one screen protector to get it right. After i put on my case, I can say I am extremely pleased and will most certainly buy these again. Thank you for providing excellent screen protectors.
0.9416348	0.8464912	Well made and does what it says. The covering is clear and I love the consistency of the material . It easily sticks without bubbles and comes off easily as well.
0.992484	0.8697071	This screen protector is everything you're looking for. It is extremely inexpensive, it comes with three covers, it has a lifetime warranty, it is easy to put on, and it is extremely thin. You can't even tell it's on your phone. I read the reviews for this product and decided I had to get it based on how happy customers were with it, and I agree with them. If you are looking for a screen cover for your iphone 5, quit looking. Buy this, not only will it be guaranteed for life and come at a cheap price, you'll also get three of them for the cheap when you only actually need one. Excellent product, excellent price. Satisfied customer.
0.5141021	0.55410796	This screen protector is of very high quality. It took only 1 minute to install. There are no fingerprints at all when using this screen protector.  It only took one day to ship!
0.9407960999999999	0.8063335	The product arrived on time and was fairly simple to apply. I mean we all have issues with these screen protectors right? This one went on well and with nearly no bubbles. It looks nice and doesn't not diminish my screen's image. I'd buy more.
0.9898546999999999	0.7388197	This is an adequate screen protector, I would recommend it to anyone.  Works well and seems to be lasting good.
0.07449019	0.6228055	Got three for half the price of the one my daughter bought. These are great and bubbles removed easily. Sometimes typed letters are skipped but still not bad
0.15719548	0.52957743	Like this and works for what I bought it for, just a total nightmare to get it on and I still had bubbles and lint (swear the thing caught lint mid-air on its sticky side while I was trying to manuver it into place!).
0.74388784	0.7216685	Easy to put one. Clear as can be - Iphone displays are still beautiful. Returned others to retail store.  More expnesive and didn't look as fine as this one.
0.027447402000000003	0.6556550999999999	Good product.  Goes on very easily, with no bubbles.  Cuts the glare, & fingerprints.  Provides decent, but not total privacy when not looking at the phone head-on.
0.86242294	0.83345973	"this product is very easy to install, goes on clean and i was able to do it with zero problems. the viewing are is huge, it can hardly be called a ""privacy screen"". i bought this because i was tired of a few people always looking over my shoulder and trying to hide it while i am texting, emailing, gaming, ect. this screen protector does let others see what you are doing, it is just blurry. i saw a privacy screen on a friends phone, and i have seen it on computers before also, it works like magic on those devices. this product does not black out the screen, but does slightly blurr it. i was very disappointed when i applied it to my phone"
0.9920237	0.7474512	Love it . Once I installed it on my phone I saw the difference in other cheap protectors. Very good quality.
0.9581907	0.7630631	Took me two of the three to get it applied properly, but that's me being anal as much as it's a knock on the product. Got the second one on flawlessly and I've already forgotten it's there. Cutouts are fine and I have no issues with it.. plus, my screen is protected, which is great because my case has no lip in case I set it down on the screen.
0.49530017	0.5508408	works just like my old one and after trying out the anti-glare screen protector from Zagg (Invisible Shield) this actually outdoes it without the weird color distortion and not having to turn off my device for 24 hours is well worth it.
0.9980440999999999	0.87807953	I decided to spend a little more on covers this time around and I'm glad I did. These covers are built well. The adhesive is strong, yet removable. Included with the 3 covers was a sticky 'lint and dust removing' pad, a cleaning cloth, an air bubble remover, and detailed instructions. I use my phone in the sun often, and these covers reduce glare very effectively. I can use the touchscreen without any problems. All in all, these seem to be a very quality products, and not a cheap imitation from Hong Kong like so many others.
0.98785794	0.7979678000000001	This is the best screen protector that i have tried so fat. it doesn't leave those nasty finger prints and smudges after each use. Perfect! I recommend it!
0.8864629999999999	0.75132775	I was looking for a durable, long lasting screen protector--when I came across Tech Armor.The reviews on Amazon as well as other sources were all positive, and they are decently priced; so I went ahead and purchased one.It's only been on for two days, so it's too early to tell if it's a reliable protector; but I received the protector the day after I placed the order and any questions I had were answered promptly by their customer service. I also like that it comes in a set of three, that way if this one starts to peel off--I already have another one standing by.
0.96615505	0.6539998	Nice looking screen protector.  Would purchase again. Nice look with my new Incipio case for my 5. Go Pack Go!!
0.008124113	0.3633734	Received fast! I slowly put them on and no matter what was air bubbles I do not recommend do not buy did not work for iphone 5
0.97821975	0.6599056999999999	I really like the privacy screen. I have it on all my electronics. Awesome product. Not easy for me o put them on but my co-worker helps me out.
0.9851675999999999	0.79725397	This product has worked great for me I really like it. It protects my screen perfectly. Fits a little off but it doesn't block anything.
0.9962741	0.8662373999999999	"I bought this product at the same time I bought a case that came with a screen protector so it took a while since I first used the alternate screen protector and not the Tech Armor one.  But I have finally replaced that stock screen protector today so here is my report on the product so far.All items were included as the package indicated.  I watched some videos on how to install this thing bubble free and I followed the instructions carefully.  I will add that I learned to use the hinge tape method to install the screen protector.  You can search for the video that show you how using the name ""Tech Armor install"" or ""screen protector hinge method"".  In my opinion it is the best and most foolproof method to install these.  Using the hinge method it was super simple to install and it just simply sealed itself onto the screen all by itself.  Once I put it in place and I peeled backing #1 I just let the protector drop onto the screen of my phone and it began to seal itself onto my phone screen all by itself, leaving no air bubbles behind.  It was really that easy.  I then installed the other two screen protectors that came in the package onto my girlfriend and her daughter's Iphone as well.  All 3 installed effortlessly and everyone was impressed with the clarity and feel of the screen protector.  I will definitely get these again when its time to replace our screen protectors.Extra advice:  be sure to wash hands before beginning, wear a non-cotton shirt, make sure there is no wind and surfaces are very well lit and dust free as best as possible.  Also, be sure to watch videos on the hinge method.  It makes installation a drop and go thing."
0.5738168	0.5919420999999999	My order of tech armor screen protectors arrived within a few days of placing my order when I purchase my iphone 5 a couple weeks later the first thing I done when I got home was to put  one of them on. I have always had bad luck putting a screen protector on in the past but with these the first went on without any problem no bubbles  I was so proud of myself
0.99605525	0.6525585999999999	Got product on time.Works perfect and would say yes to this company and product.Great price good product.Buy buy buy.
0.008261353	0.5032795999999999	Purchased this thinking it would have good quality like the most recent reviews said, sad to say I wasted my money purchasing this. it comes with 3 in a pack, you have 2 extras, not for later use, but for trial and error with applying the plastic on your screen. the cut-outs are not aligned with the phone's home button. tried reapplying a couple times but more bubbles form then. wasted all three protectors, none of them was cutout correctly.
0.95530033	0.6395759	This is one good protector! i say this because the protector its self is a thick protector not like the other protectors you buy at other places!!! Love this product!!!
0.7604841	0.69304085	I notice that I can't align the screen protector to the hole and I tried several times with the screen protector. I am pretty good aligning screen protectors it from other devices i have owned. There are a few scratches from everyday usage but that's normal.
0.962181	0.8615197	I just got a new iphone and decided to go with Tech Armor because it had so many good reviews. I was super excited and didn't even bother watching the videos or reading many other reviews. My first two times putting the screen protector on came out pretty bad - there were lots of bubbles and dust particles, but then I realized that I was putting it on on the wrong side (didn't see the little numbers on the tabs). Entirely my fault!!But I still emailed to ask if I could get a replacement for my wasted attempts, and they sent one out right away in first class USPS mail and advised me to install in a more humid environment and get rid of dust with scotch tape (which I will do when I get the replacements)! Definitely best customer service around!Other than my clumsy installation and bubbles, the screen protector fits perfectly and it feels like there's nothing on the phone at all! If you notice the little numbers on the tabs, they're super easy screen protectors to put on (which is great for a clumsy person like me), you just align with the screen and it sticks on!
0.9614205	0.79217076	I've been looking for a screen protector for my iPhone 5 ever since I noticed I was beginning to get scratches on it because I throw it around a lot. Then I came to the conclusion that I also wanted a privacy screen for the times I'm in class or work so people don't read my screen. This Tech Armor one really is great. It was really easy to put on which no bubbles at all and it fits the screen perfectly. The package was delivered super quickly and in good condition. The touch on fingers is really nice --- not too soft or hard and it comes with a special cloth to wipe away  finger smudges. The lighting is not necessarily too dim because I never had to adjust it, but that is all personal preference. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.
0.8114208	0.6676828	Easy to apply in just a few minutes.  The film is also a bit more rigid than the film that came with Otterbox case, so it is more forgiving if you miss a piece of dust and must peel it back to remove the speck.
0.9824556000000001	0.5806198	I like them they are exactly the ones I need for my iphone 5, I will keep looking for products.
0.6741059	0.6506251999999999	So far, no complains. I only had it for two weeks and it doesn't disappoint me so far. It was easy to put on I didn't had problem with the bubble that was so annoying. I had different screen protector before and I used 3 protectors before getting the right spot on my phone because of the annoying bubble.
0.9675902	0.69600844	I got this screen protector for my new iphone 5, it is very useful and protect the phone.  Thx a lot.
0.9991796999999999	0.8225374	I am very pleased with the Product and was exactly as I had expected it to be. Would highly recommend this to folks who do not like a gloss finish on their cell phone screen protectors.And a good price for a 3-pack - compared to what you get in the stores - definitely worth the wait for a couple of days!!
0.71477604	0.6781316	Very good build material. Only I find a little off align with Home button, speaker, front view camera. May be I've not able to align properly, a very little air bubble at the lower right  corner, hardly visible.Overall it's a good buy.
0.65398383	0.48019743	I just got this product around 2 hr back and i really like the quality of screen. But the cleaning cloth was not so good and everytime i install it left with some dust and bubble. I wasted all three screen protector in the kit and left with no screen protection. May be its my fault that i could not install it correctly. But i will prefer this product and have to get one more for my. I am sure i will be able to install next time.But overall its a good quality product comparing with its price.  Not to mention, shipping was very fast...
0.99592566	0.7952088	It was really easy to put on my phone. I loved the fact that it came with everything you need to put it on correctly. Easy and works great.
0.99373746	0.80368316	Easy to install and they work wonderfully.  I cannot say enough good things about these screen protectors and reasonable for the price.
0.9972384	0.66160524	It is very easy to apply and is a great product. great price and would recommend to some friends . Thank u
0.9305253000000001	0.6984145	I was able to put the cover on myself with no problems at all.  It comes with a &#34;card&#34; to help you lay it smoothly.  If it is your first time, I suggest you have someone help you.  I am able to see my screen with no problem and I am still able to use my touch screen.
0.9918113000000002	0.8077032	The Tech Armor arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was a little difficult to apply in just the right spot and a couple of air bubbles are still under the the Armor! The film is easy to clean and does not interfere with my phones interfacing.
0.048291832	0.43963987	Its small...doesnt cover the entire area of the iphone. Theres a section clearly visible thats left unprotcted. And its grainy....webpages show the grain....im very disappointed.
0.98066235	0.8360789000000001	Just received these today and adhered them to our phones. The directions are super clear (they even offer a website tutorial) and include a lint free cloth. They fit the iphone5c very nicely and work well so far...I can barely see it AND it doesn't seem to have any affect on the phone's functionality.
0.6577866	0.5927628	The picture instructions are really helpful and simple to follow. I think they help a lot when you are trying this for the first time. However, I still had a lot of bubbles. I guess it is understandable considering it is my first time. I tried again a second time, hoping to get it right, but still managed to get in a few bubbles. I think if i apply pressure every now and then, my phone will eventually be bubble free. Other than the bubble issue, the instructions are top notch.
0.95934093	0.8239141	I really like this protective film for a number of reasons: 1) It went on very easily and the few air bubbles that occurred were easy to remove, 2) the film is a matte finish so finger prints don't show, 3) the iPhone is much easier to read in the sun with this anti-glare protection on it than with it's regular screen, and 4) there is no interference when touching the screen, response is immediate.  The only downside is that the color of your iPhone won't show with this film on, but then I care more about how it works than how it looks.The package comes with 3 protective films, enough to see me through at least a years protection.  Well worth the small amount it cost.
0.9894780000000001	0.77972	Reading the other reviews I was nervous about applying the screen protector. Instead I watched their video on you tube (they suggest you do !) and then I have applied the screen protect. Easy and fast!
0.9948528	0.77656305	I just got these protectors and I can say that I am so glad it came with three because I needed all of them. This is my first iPhone so I had no idea what I was doing and I messed up with the first two protectors. Thankfully I got it right with the third one but I don't know what I would've done if I had bought the more expensive screen protector that only came with one from Speck or some of the other name brands. The price is amazing and it gives you room to screw up so I definitely recommend these!
0.99043727	0.7903514	The screen protector was great, more than I expected.  The matte protector is amazing, you can not see any finger prints and it cleans easily.
0.43025810000000003	0.30728140000000004	I like the look of this protector, but it already has little &#34;snags&#34; in it.  I haven't ever had that happen before, so I don't know what caused it... they are like something has caught on the protector.
0.35543242	0.63772345	This screen protector is as good as any, with one exception.  The design folks got cute and added yellow paper tabs onto the screen protector and the backer, presumably to make it easier to remove the protector from the backer.  I was able to get the screen protector installed without bubbling.  However, one of the yellow paper tabs left adhesive on the front of the screen protector.  My phone looks like it had an old-school price tag on the screen.  Not the end of the world, but kind of annoying that I'll have to put goo-gone on my phone.
0.8708004	0.69339716	This would be awesome!!! I loved it and would give it five stars!!BUTIt didn't fit with my lifeproof case. I didn't know that. Can't use both. Chose the lifeproof case and trashed the tech armor :(
0.9842534	0.8451108	This screen protector does indeed provide 360 degrees of privacy. I am now able to leave my iPhone 5 right in front of me during meetings and the people next to me can NOT see my screen. No more embarrassing moments if my sweetheart decides to send a 'lovey' text when my phone is out, nor can the guy next to me on the bus read my private emails. I also LOVE the thickness of the protector. It's heavier than regular screen protectors and made application a breeze.  Also pleased that it works in landscape mode as well, unlike other privacy screens I've used for the iPad.
0.0019072294	0.46720716	The whole purpose of the new iPhone 5 is that it has a HD retina screen.This screen protector defeats this whole new screen by making everything looked pixelated/rainbow dots.Do not waste your time. Look elsewhere.
0.99259686	0.6710147	AWESOME! it includes everything you need to put the protector on. Card, Non lint wipe, directions, Even emailed me to make sure I liked it. Talk about great customer service
0.86336887	0.738128	Everything they advertised and more. Perfect anti-glare, anti-fingerprint screen protector. If you're not used to it, it can be a little annoying in direct sunlight, but that's the point of anti-glare. Great company-delivered everything on time and got the order right. Will definitely purchase these again when the time comes.
0.9613794	0.6654821999999999	it's a little tricky to put on but once it's on it's like its not even there. wonderful product love it
0.9934639999999999	0.76836395	This product was easy to apply and was applied without any problems on the first try! No bubbles either! Will order from this company again for my family's other phones. Really a great product.
0.86896473	0.7867206999999999	Well its doing the job its being purchased for. Simple and lightweight , though we messed up with  the first screen , we got it correct the second screen guard.
0.8651129999999999	0.7402529999999999	The protector is easy to apply and is very, very clear - it almost doesn't look like you have a screen protector on. The only downside is that it does show finger marks like crazy. But the unprotected screen did too, so that was not a big negative.
0.9988568999999999	0.84908414	For anyone looking for a crystal clear screen protector, look no further. This is absolutely excellent. Just as a forewarning these are like an exact fit so putting it on can be a little trick but NOT impossible. Just be patient and careful, follow all of their directions, and it will come out flawless. It took me a little bit to get mine perfect. I used one as a practice sheet to get the hang of it. Would definitely recommend! Especially for the price!
0.94008636	0.5221150999999999	Can't even tell I have a screen protector on. I followed the instructions and it's a good product. Love it.
0.9816455	0.745732	Awesome. Saved my phone SO many times it's ridiculous, and while I have acquired scratches, the nature of the material is that they are difficult to notice. OUTSTANDING phone protection!!
0.99305135	0.7835703	Best iPhone 5 screen protector to buy-anti glare-thick layer-scratch proofBest of all:- great low  affordable price.
0.9869296999999999	0.8544149999999999	I was skeptical when I opened the box (looking to keep my phone protection minimal, almost didn't get my Laza clear case at all) but very happy with it on the phone.  Fingers move across it more smoothly than even the bare glass!
0.97951245	0.77268803	When I received this product and installed it, the corner was not fitting correctly (operator error). Emailed them, and recieved a new one in no time. They didn't even ask, just needed order #. Properly installed and what an amazing product. You notice a thin layer on top of screen but if your looking for privacy in all angles this is the product to get. I txt in the middle of class and my classmates near me have a hard time seeing what I'm doing. Now if you guys only made it for the ipad. Great product, great customer service. Thanks!
0.94060516	0.7600262	Tech Armor screen protectors definitely outperform the competition. Unlike Skinomi covers where you only get 1 skin and applying the protector is like a science project (plus you have to wait 24 hours to use your phone again), you get three protectors for the same price without a needlessly complicated process to apply the thing. And, of course, you can start using your phone again right away.The one hitch with any screen protector is making sure your screen is completely clean before applying. How diligent you are here will determine your results. I spent at least five minutes making sure my screen was completely clean without any dust particles on it, looking over ever square inch. Another common hitch is air bubbles, but these protectors are packaged with a plastic card that helps you force out any air bubbles that may have gotten trapped.My only complaint is that the first screen I tried to apply was somehow dirty out of the box and had to be discarded, but with there being two other protectors this ended up being a non-issue.
0.9568441999999999	0.7649258000000001	This has been the first screen protector I have been able to apply without any bubbles or dust left under the screen. The dust remover sticker helped!!! Once applied you can't even tell there is a screen protector over the screen...super clear!
0.9977584	0.78537405	This is good product quality, is the best protector that I have ever tried, no fingerprints, cleans easy, will buy more of this product for my family and for my friends!!!
0.14259526	0.4649679	It's seems like a good screen protector, it's not perfectly cut for the iPhone 5, butdo the job, but I wouldn't know because my attempts resulted in either it bubbling or dust got in between the screen an the screen protector. I kept it on for while on my screen, but over time the bubbles got worse and more dust collected, otherwise if put on correctly, it probably would have worked well.
0.9039748	0.74488175	This is a very good matte protector. Eliminates all the issues one would face with a glossy protector ( bubbles, scratches gets old). good experience for touch gestures. good price
0.97908205	0.78740394	Works really well and great value for the price.  Only complaint is that you can see all the finger prints and stuff on the screen but it is no different than if you had no protector all.  I used to have the matte version that did not show all the finger prints but I still prefer this HD version.  Will buy again if needed.
0.9657114	0.8194249	I got this screen protector with the understanding that they stated clearly that by getting a matte protector, I would be losing some of the vibrance from my screen. I hate seeing fingerprints all over my screen, and I sometimes let my kids use it, so I figured that the loss of vibrance would be worth the trade-off. I'm not a super tech-y person, so it wasn't a huge deal to me. The pack comes with 3 protectors. I put the first one on my husband's phone and had a little bit of trouble simultaneously getting it lined up right/getting out all of the bubbles/making sure it was speck-free. I think I had to take his off once or twice to get out a pesky speck, and in my previous experience with other screen covers, it's been the kiss of death to have to try to reapply one that you've already put on. The lint-removing tape that they included in the package is what saved the day, and I was able to get the same protector back on his phone. I did mine next, and partly due to luck, I was able to get it on, lined up, and bubble-free the first time. The company seems to be very committed to doing what they can to help you get these installed correctly, so that seems nice. The only reason that I deducted a star is because I'm not sure how much I like the dulling of the images, even though it's not too bad. But on the flip side, I do love not seeing all the smears and fingerprints. It does not at all affect the sensitivity of my screen, and overall, I do recommend this product. It was a really great deal for the price.
0.9437506	0.7206786000000001	Can't even tell its on. I had a bit of trouble putting it on myself (have never put a screen protector on), but my husband was able to put it on perfectly.
0.10764906	0.54594886	I was not very satisfied with this product because when I put it on, I realized it was scratched, even before I had a chance to use it! I looked at the other two that were in the pack, and they had scratched too! Very unsatisfied!
0.99715316	0.7628999	Easy to install and good product. Great price as well. All definitely be lurching more of these or recommending them to others.
0.92601144	0.8301203000000001	"Screen shipped fast and included cloth to clean screen before installation and piece of cardboard to remove bubbles after the screen protector is applied.Typical screen protector, does the job but it is highly reflective - makes the phone's screen difficult to read.  The screen is clear and allows me to read the screen clearly under indoor conditions.  The screen collects oil and fingerprints very well.  Need to clean the screen almost twice a day.After installing the screen protector I was able to add my iPhone 5 Speck Candyshell Grip case without causing the screen protector to bubble up.Note: the small area below the ""home button"" is not covered like other screen protectors.I decided not to go with the matte screen protectors (of any brand) because of the potential color distortion and pixelation."
0.98072493	0.8108928000000001	These are the best screen protectors I used so far. Very easy to put on without any bubbles.It really is anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. You pay little more but it is much better product.
0.008488476	0.333511	I only gave this one star because there were so many bubbles it was absolutely impossible to get all the bubbles out. I ended up throwing them away and going to ghost armor to have it protected.  Don't waste your money like I did.
0.926076	0.7714472	Works well and protects my phone. It is a little tricky to get on with out creating air bubbles. But once it's on, it stay put.
0.6312547	0.5937848000000001	It is a little too matte.  Able to install without too much trouble - some bubble developed when I put it in the case - otherwise it will do the job.
0.9760200000000001	0.7589723	I never had a smartphone screen protector. As I was reading different reviews to find it how difficult to attach a screen protector on an iPhone, I was worried about this product. To my surprise, the screen protector was easy to use. Moreover, there were two more screen protectors in the same case. Had I messed up with the first one, still had two other screen protectors to try out. I am satisfied!
0.57592887	0.6699176	Easy to stick to the phone; just one layer to stick to the phone screen; matte surface responds really well to the touch sensitive screen below.
0.45852035	0.5469025	I was able to apply the screen protector on my phone in less than a minute -- with no bubbles. I've gone through other products that have taken me hours to apply and that have still resulted in unsightly bubbles.
0.5545858	0.55216783	I did mess up on the first try (dust particles). I could have avoided that if I hadn't taken too long to align the film. Once it was on, you can barely tell that there's a screen protector on it. Love it!
0.039192885	0.59777117	I know the term you get what you pay for speaks for itself, but it wasn't even in its original packaging and they're two missing! DOn't buy from this individual.
0.9988716999999999	0.8827894000000001	Delivery was on time! This protecter looks great on my phone and it does not show my fingerprints and does not have a glare as promised on the package! This is also at a great price and the quality makes me feel like it was a steal! LOVE this product! will recommend to anyone!
0.14279935	0.53207934	The screen scratches way too easily. I keep it in a separate purse pocket but it still got a bunch of thin scratches after just 5 days. I'm really disappointed with the quality. The screen protector I used before did not have this issue and was much more durable.
0.8177959	0.6731683	I like the matte finish.  It can take up to two tries to put it on straight but once on, it's great!
0.0015560985	0.5250307	I had my cord for one month before it stopped working. What a waste of money. I was so disappointed.
0.6419402	0.7148581999999999	Overall I'd say nothing is wrong with the product the cut-outs are perfect since they don't block any of the sensors which other screen protectors do, also there is no interference with the quality of the HD retina display which makes this a must have screen protector. Protection without loss of quality, is what I think should be the slogan for Tech Armour's screen protectors, although the great quality the install isn't the easiest process to do. I sadly ruined the first two screen protectors and the third I also did ruin also, but I didn't remove it for the sake of the protection. I guess the fault is mine so I cannot blame Tech Armour for my dissatisfaction because I have used their products before and I gotta say they are great! And a greatly priced on top of all!
0.68628275	0.5752708000000001	I bought this for my iphone 5 and it was a great buy. Easy to put on and it looks like nothings is there. I work at target, and the protectors we sale there are garbage. I tried applying one for the guest and it was hard, and came out ugly. Luckily i had extra one of these protectors and i gave it to my guest.
0.53856784	0.6369686	It's a great protector, the only tricky part is aligning it. I ended up with the top a little off, but NO bubbles. If you start at one end like in the video on youtube, you should't have bubbles, but it's hard to get it perfectly aligned. They do give you three in case you screw up. I tried a set of these previously on a Nexus 4 and it was awful, the bubbles were impossible to avoid or remove - no idea what the difference was but this iphone one is solid.
0.9960059000000001	0.85099506	This is my first iPhone and the first screen protector I ever bought.  I have a friend who has one as well and she has never had to replace the protector in the almost 2 years she has had her phone despite the fact she keeps it in her purse.  As for me I like the anti-glare effect it has on the screen and it does not interfere at all with the touch capabilities of the screen. It took me a couple tries to get it on straight but then this was my first time using one.  I like the fact it came with a cloth to clean the screen and a &#34;squeegee&#34; to help put the protector on and smooth out any bubbles.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
0.9924014999999999	0.8377326999999999	Very pleased how well this screen protector worked and looks, yes it takes a little from the beautiful display of the phone but you can used to it.  It mainly keeps fingerprints in check which was driving me crazy on the clear ones cause of my OCD.  For the price it's a quality product. Very satisfied.
0.97136265	0.652675	Worked pretty well , it's just what i was looking for. I would reccomend this to my friends for sure.
0.45675287	0.48279202	Really good for the white iphone in my opinion.may not matter to most people but design leaves top exposed so if u had rough stuff in your pockets all the time you will still get it scratched at the very top.i love mine !
0.9942350000000001	0.7981379	The screen protector is perfect. The best protector on the market by far. It is long lasting and Very durable.
0.9655689000000001	0.8051640999999999	I've always had problems installing a screen protector due to lack of tools or accessories.  It's really easy to apply the plastic film on your smartphone but your number 1 enemy is the dust and/or lint.  However, with the help of the video/instructions and using the lint/dust tape that was included in the package, I can say I had a bubble free install.  I had to lift the film back several times and use the tape to remove the annoying lint.  This was very easy to install, easy to lift back using the provided tape (for dust) and a very good instructional video.Yes, I would recommend this product and you won't regret it.It would be nice if there were extra dust/lint tape, but I saved the used one for future install.
0.88102746	0.7303048000000001	They are good covers, they provide great protection. I like how they send you three in one pack, especially because it took me all three to get the cover on decently, still not perfect.For some reason the covers that I got were kind of too small it seemed like. If I had to get more I'ld buy more Tech Armor though. They provide quality covers, for an affordable price.
0.9962634	0.71236986	The product is really good. I love it. It fits very well and I would recommend this product to anyone how has an Iphone 5.
0.9702622999999999	0.81288993	Good, screen protection.  It doesn't take anything away from the display, and it's easily installed.  I received it earlier than what was estimated, which is always good.  Just be careful lining it up when installing, that was the only issue I had, had to take it off and re-apply again.  I would definitely recommend this product.
0.0022738278	0.35970306	Did not work! I followed instructions and had bubbles all over the screen almost impossible to push them off. Wasted all 3 screen covers with bad results. will not buy it again.
0.94989145	0.57196176	100% recommended for those who do not like the screen to be sticky in anyway.  It makes even easier to work on iPhone 5.
0.97887444	0.7372694000000001	The screen protector is great. I love the anti-glare. After I put mine on, I scratched it. I emailed customer service, and 48 hours later there was a new one on my door step. Their warranty is great!
0.99809134	0.87512666	After reading quite a few negative opinions on the Net about screen protectors for the iPhone, I was not sure whether I should buy one, but was worried at the same time about scratches on my new phone.  I do know about the Gorilla glass, but I have also seen my colleagues' phones which have scratches on them.The Tech Armor set has good reviews on Amazon, and I went ahead with the purchase anyway, with low expectations.  The product arrived on time, and installation was easy to do (though it does need some careful handling).  I would strongly suggest that you watch the setup video on Tech Armor's web site, as it gives nice step-by-step instructions on getting the protector on the phone correctly the first time.Each protector in the package comes with two back-to-back stick-on films, and there is a specific sequence in which they need to be peeled off.  This was probably the only place where I had to lookup the instruction again; other than that, the setup was painless and quick.The actual protector looks quite good on the phone, and almost blends in with the faceplate of the phone.  I did not face any issues with the touch functions, and the protector seems to be placed quite well without any play.Overall a quality product and I can definitely recommend this one.
0.9960787	0.7900655	Good product I would definitely recommend. The screen protector was very easy to apply and pretty much invisible once on.
0.9528916999999999	0.65925074	The quality of this screen protector is impressive!  It was a bit difficult to apply and I went through 2 of the screens before I finally got it right. However that was my fault. I did not follow instructions. Take your time and follow the instructions for a smooth, clean look!
0.19464892	0.5489184	Scratched within the first hour of being on my phone.  Since 2 more came in the package, put another on... it scratched by the next morning. It does it's job, but not well. Either that or I got a dud.
0.9966811	0.6116305000000001	Perfect got here by Christmas Eve, thanks so much. Super cute. Super easy to use. Connects to Siri! Perfect gift for anyone
0.007652551	0.44195846	What a sad excuse for a privacy screen. From the side, the screen is still visible -- it is only dimmed, not completely dark. Friend has one that completely blackens the screen from the side view. Really disappointed in this product, guess I'll be shopping around for another one. Wish I could get my money back.
0.9356831	0.6534082	I really liked it  . Installation is a little bit  tricky but you can see instructional videos on youtube for that .
0.018343002	0.63592887	Thank goodness the package comes with 3! The first one I applied incorrectly, and # 2 went on much better. However, it only stayed on for about 5 months and started peeling around the edges. When I retrieved my third, it was barely sticky despite being stored properly. It seemed to stay on when I attached my case, but I am still going to have to buy a new screen protector. Also, the tabs that you peel off leave a terrible residue. I know others like these, but they just didn't work out well for me.
0.99442506	0.82898504	I was hesitant to buy these based on all the reviews about how difficult it was to put on without having bubbles and lint and crap.... but one try was all I needed and you can't even tell it's on. Super easy!!How I did it was slightly different than the directions: first I wet a paper towel with windex and lightly cleaned the screen (I did this on my ipad, too, and it worked great). I did all this under my stove vent (thanks to another review's advice). Then I followed the directions on the package. Worked like a charm, easiest application of a screen protector I've ever done.
0.99606395	0.85643244	These screen protectors are exactly what I was looking for! They were inexpensive and they get the job done. They do collect some fingerprints, but I don't really care because they can be easily wiped off and my screen is well protected. I recommend this product!
0.9945394000000001	0.84491813	This was the first time where I had no bubbles from putting on a protective screen. I did use a rubbery tool to push some of them out though. I used some tape to collect the dust off the screen before placement too. I love these screens - they leave no room for error. The cut outs in the screen are perfectly aligned so be really careful when applying. I will definitely buy more of these in the future.
0.92181426	0.7071474	Good value since you get 3 for half the price of 1 Sir Lancelot screen protector.  I had problems applying the Sir Lancelot protector and when I posted my feedback they attacked my review.  Buy these and save money and support a better vendor.
0.07864773	0.49363026	i wont repurchase it again and i've read the ratings before buying it. majority of the ppls loved it and i guess why not. let me give it a shot. i had trouble putting it on and created a lot of bubbles. i'd have gone for the matte one instead of this.
0.9989866	0.8570664000000001	This is a great deal for a screen protectors.  I no longer have finger prints all over my screen after using it.  This product comes highly recommended!!
0.9477545	0.70325106	Had some trouble getting the screen protector on and smushing out all the bubbles but once on, it's great.  Shipped fast!
0.56539965	0.5665484000000001	When on, the screen looks like there is nothing is on it. Also, the protectors did not hinder the touch sensitivity. The instructions were easy to follow, but the product was still a little difficult to apply. I did not have any air bubbles, but a few pieces of dust were trapped. They are so small and are not noticeable when my phone is on though, so they do not really bother me. I would buy these again.
0.6396404	0.61986953	These are awesome! they do slightly decrease the high resolution but it doesnt' look bad quality, you can tell its because of the matte. no fingerprints and not that hard to avoid bubbles because it comes with a sticky thing to remove dust.
0.20981455	0.39937425	This is ok. You get what you pay for. Nothing great as such but it is ok. it is ok.
0.63688725	0.48047376	This protector is good and solves it purpose. I would give 4 * if it comes with liquid to apply protector easily on screen.
0.9843216	0.8698290000000001	This screen protector is one of the best I have used so far. I have used Zagg shield all the time for my previous phone buy due to the price so high for Zagg shield, I opted to get the Tech Armor instead. The purpose of a screen protector is to protect the screen from scratches most f the time and this screen protector excels at.The installation of the screen protector is very easy. You just wipe the phone screen with a cloth and apply. I was done within minutes. The only thing about the protector is that the dimensions are not 100% but it is barely noticeable. When you look at the screen after putting the protector, it feels like that there is no protector and you still enjoy the retina display quality.I definitely will recommend this screen protector to anyone looking to protect their screen from scratches. The price is reasonable and the quality is equivalent or even better than the top name brands. After all who looks at brand name on screen protectors.
0.99632514	0.76798445	i have got this screen protector for my wife and friends. everyone love it. Screen still is crystal clear. no drop in retina
0.97858346	0.8028291999999999	Exceptional product. Very easy to install, if the instructions are followed properly. Extremely easy to get rid of bubbles, and even the cover. One area where product can be improved is the glare from the screen protector. Glares from the screen(after installing the protector) under light can be uneasy for a few. But overall awesome product, a must buy.
0.9975263000000001	0.7869744000000001	This is a great product. Easy to use on the iphone and the quality is excellent. I recomend this product.
0.9983399	0.8377644000000001	I work with cellphones for my company, troubleshoot, activate, support, etc. and part of my job is keeping them in great shape including putting on new screen protectors when needed. We have everything from the iPhone 3GS on and over the years I have tried several different brands. Some good and some very bad. These screen protectors are hands down the best I have ever used. They are easy to apply and the screen looks very natural.
0.9889165999999999	0.8313053	This is the second screen protector Ive bought for the Iphone 5, the first one being from Clearplex. The Clearplex one was a wet apply and left a ton of bubbles. This one is a million times better as there is no bubbles, super easy to apply and you get 3 for the price of one. Would highly recommend this!
0.9100075000000001	0.6190861	I think reviews are sometimes beyond what we expect and makes us fear. But also we can learn how to use the things we buy. I read the reviews and learned just the way what is true and what is wrong while applying these protectors. And I am now using this brand and It is really satisfactory for me. If you got bothered while you applying the protector read more reviews and watch the youtube for some previous experience available. That is it.
0.9971639000000001	0.83793044	Both the product and the company behind it are top-notch. The screen protector was super easy and straight-forward to install. (I got it on my second try because I derped on the first one.) This is the first screen protector I have installed that has no air bubbles. Kudos to Tech Armor for that one! The screen protector is high quality, it doesn't feel as smooth as the glass behind it, but it actually does feel like armor, and I'm confident it will stand up to a lot of abuse. Tech Armor is committed to customer service and will do everything in their power to make sure you're satisfied. Thank you Tech Armor!
0.9778701	0.6881027	I loved the screen protector. Covers the whole screen.Arrived on time.I would recommend this product to one and all.
0.91770184	0.73417777	This actually was a great buy I thought it was fairly easy to put on, I do still have a bubble on the side but its hardly noticeable. It came promptly.
0.9992694999999999	0.8659511999999999	I recently purchased my first iPhone and am extremely protective of it. The phone store, of course, tried to sell me a 2-pack of screen protectors for $14. Since two other family members also purchased iPhones the 2-pack did us no good and the 3-pack was even more expensive per screen protector!So I headed over to Amazon, where found these Tech Armor screen protectors. They are great! My protector was easy to place and fits the phone perfectly. Having two more for the other iPhones in our family is really helpful and the price sure beats the phone store's. Most importantly, my expensive phone's screen is protected.
0.52868915	0.08757672	IT WORKS OK  WHAT MORE CAN ONE SAY ABOUT A SCREEN PROTECTOR OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
0.5639003	0.5600824000000001	Installer must have patience and follow directions when installing protector. Took numerous attempts. End result was worth the extreme aggravation.
0.9973404	0.8730439	I have used screen protectors like this in the past, and have always had trouble getting them on without bubbles being left on. This screen protector went on very easily and I was able to get ALL the bubbles out very easily. It took a total of 5 minutes to put one on my phone and one on my wife's. I highly recommend this product.
0.9862075000000001	0.81354856	I bought this product and messed up putting on 2 of the 3 screen protectors (completely my fault). I got it right the 3rd time and the screen protector lasted a very long time until I dropped my phone while mountain biking. The screen protector had just one or two small scratches, and still held up. I contacted the company asking for them if they could replace the one screen protector and they sent me a brand new pack of 3 completely free of charge. This is by far the best customer support I have ever experienced. I recommend buying these screen protectors to anyone that wants a high quality product for a low price, and will be secured with a lifetime guarantee. Tech armor really believes in their product and stands behind their warranty 100%
0.8361732	0.7306352	I bought this to put on my iPhone 5 after getting tired of the fingerprints. It worked as intended but i found my self loving how it made my screen feel after taking the protector off, the feel was nice and lasted a while before I put another on took it off again.
0.9347544	0.7878109000000001	Works just fine! Got it really fast and have not had any problems with it. Barely even noticeable that its on the screen, and the touch is still great!
0.9973888000000001	0.8175169	I got the sheet on exactly right the second time around.  It's good quality, nice and thick, and easy to put on.  Fits the iPhone 5 perfectly.  Very matte and fingerprint/smudge resistant (not perfect though).  Good product.
0.99778724	0.79995775	My husband bought me a new iPhone and these are the perfect addition to ensure it stays looking new! It arrived ahead of schedule, which was great!
0.26441088	0.47995102	When I bought this screen protector my first experience was okay-ish! So, I ended up giving it only a 3 star. On seeing my feedback, the customer support reached out to me promptly and they sent me a replacement right away!What i feel good about is that for such a small value product, they took their business seriously and were professional about it!
0.9362304	0.7289526	I recived my product (Screen protector) pretty fast for standard shipping.The screen proctector fit perfect on my Iphone 5 and you can go to youtube for instruction on how to avoid the bubbles on your screen.So it workout for me.
0.9475094000000001	0.4332718	So far so good.
0.9904796	0.58914113	Just what I ordered and the quality is quite superior. Offers great protection so get yours today and keep your iPhone 5 well protected.
0.9873765999999999	0.66010475	this is the best screen protector i have since i got my iphone5.. nice feel. what i like is the lifetime warranty!
0.5482423000000001	0.41986486	I get asked all the time if I have something covering my screen. This very question tells me they were looking at it and could not see it. I love this thing. Only issue if that someone from behind can still see, but on the side, not at all.
0.65736383	0.6110380999999999	these are the best clear screen protectors i have found to date.  There is one way to ensure you don't get bubbles, like with most protectors is hard to avoid....put it on FAST and with no trace of dust on the screen. The second a dust particle slips under the protector, its wasted.  Thank goodness there are 3 in a pack.  It took me 2 tries, and voila!  Perfection!!!
0.9923509	0.8024924	I purchased this product after reading other reviews regarding the great customer service that this company had provided.  Since I am not saavy at using these types of products, I figured good customer service would be a plus.I received my screen protectors before the estimated arrival date.  I read the directions carefully, and was able to install the screen protector without much trouble.  I did have trouble lining up the product perfectly at first, but I was able to peel it back and readjust it without any trouble.  There are no bubbles, and it fits the screen of my iphone 5 perfectly.  I also have not had any trouble with corners bubbling or peeling.
0.8997743	0.8193939	The screen protector is great quality, crystal clear, easy to install.While the home button lines up perfectly, the holes towards the top are misaligned.  They are cut larger and off center, not sure what the reasoning for it being off center, may be a quality control issue.  But they do not block the operation of the camera nor do they affect your volume.A stock cardboard card is included to help smooth out the bubbles during installation.  A plastic card would have been better.
0.8872110999999999	0.7905489	"I just received the Tech Armor screen protector for iPhone 5 this morning (a funny story is that I couldn't find the screen protector inside the Amazon carton box at first, but as it turned out, it was tucked away neatly inside the bottom carton folds. So check there before calling Amazon for missing items)The package comes with ""three"" screen protectors. I actually found that a little wasteful because I don't know what I can do with the two screen protectors once I place one on. So ask your friends around and see if you can find two to share the screen protectors with you. Otherwise, it is just going to sit in your drawer for the next x years, gathering dustsThe instruction from the package is very straightforward, even for first-timers (I am a second timer with screen protectors.... first time was with iPhone 4). I cleaned the screen very well, removed all the tiny dusts, and peeled off the layer one, and started from the bottom, and worked my way up. One important tip I can provide here is that in addition to align the screen protector to the bottom left edge of the iPhone screen (so the screen protector looks straight on the phone), I would highly suggest you also align the home button.Now, another complaint I have here is that they didn't align their front facing camera hole + receiver opening with the iPhone 5. No matter how much you try, you will always have one-sided openings. Either that or you have a screen protector that does not look straight on the phone. This defect applies to all three screen protectors that come with the box.Update: Thanks to the education from the manufacturer in the comment, I understand better why the camera openings are elongated. Thus, updated the rating to reflect the knowledge."
0.97833717	0.74389267	Excellent product, no glare no bubbles, was able to install in one go with ease. Moreover you hardly feel it's there
0.9936205	0.75924003	This screen protector is one of best I have purchased. I got this one for my husbands new iphone5S and you can't tell it's even on there like the others. The HD works and there's no glare. Looks very nice that I am soon to buy one for my new iPhone 4S. Thanks
0.9619	0.76528853	The protector is very clear (a good thing), had trouble putting it on because I have a white iPhone; aligning perfectly was a bit of a chore.  After I applied the protector to my liking, it looked as if it wasn't even there.  The price is very reasonable for 3 quality screen protectors with a soft piece of cloth to clean the screen with.  Very happy with my purchase.
0.96255744	0.8086011	Initially, when I received the product, I failed to apply all 3 screen protectors that came with the package. That is not unusual with these type of dry screen protectors, and as expected, Tech Armor honored their satisfaction guarantee and sent me a new pack of screen protectors which I successfully applied. I received the replacement extremely fast and their replies to my messages were prompt as well. I made the mistake of purchasing screen protectors from Verizon once, and their policy is no returns, no exchanges, nothing(and they even tell you that it is expected to not always perfectly apply the screen protector, but they just don't care for your satisfaction; they just want your money). Overall, I am very satisfied. I was initially thinking of giving 4 stars because although the quality of the screen protector is quite good, more than you would expect for the price, it still does not feel of the highest quality. But as I said, it is more than worth what you pay, so overall it has exceeded my expectations, only to disappoint them by not being of the highest quality due to my great satisfaction with the product and service.
0.7944781	0.70749056	"In the past, I have bought products such as Zagg, Invisible Shield, and Military Armor...etc. These screen protectors are ""gelly-like"" screen protectors that supposedly ""coat"" the tips of helicopter blades to prevent erosion. Despite that cool fact, they are quite expensive and I decided to try Tech Armor. The one feature however, that I liked about the other products is that you can shift around the screen protector while it is ""moist"" and get a perfect application. Tech Armor's application is not as easy as it seems - even after you watch the video. The appication is more like applying a sticker - you have to apply it perfectly - otherwise you have to peel it off again. Luckily they give you 3 attempts; but that doesn't necessarily IMPROVE your chances of getting a perfect application because it is very difficult to begin with. I ended up using all 3 of the protectors; resorting to be ""satisified"" with the last one because I had none left. I used my own method of application - trying to allign both bottom and top centered (different from their video) in the end because the first two attempts weren't working out for me and dust was just accumulating on the screen. Though I am not entirely satisfied with my final application, I am happy in the fact that there are no bubbles. I hope they somehow improve their video, or make the application process easier...EDIT: Got a prompt reply from customer service, and they sent me a new product ASAP. Very satisfied with the service, will update on how the new screen protectors hold."
0.19116756	0.36974478	I find screen protectors to be confusing to place on the device which side is right.  It's hard to get used to the look and feel due to the anti glare part.
0.006370931999999999	0.41481385	Please don't waste your money. This screen protector only came with a protective sheet 1 and not 2 like other screen protectors. I wouldn't recommend
0.6357581999999999	0.52852714	love the smudgeproof aspect.  it can catch sometimes when you're scrolling.  i dont know if its a phone glitch or the case but it can sometimes become less reactive to touch as compared to a non-matte screen protector.
0.9985224	0.78553104	Best Matte screen protector I have ever used, easy to install and durable .i am used to install deferent expensive brands of screen protector, this one by far is the best.
0.7780267	0.52439743	I bought an Otterbox case for my iPhone 5 and found the screen protector included with that very difficult to put on.  It never got on right, so I bought these Tech Armor ones.  After looking at the package for a couple of weeks, I decided to tackle it.  I wrestled the OtterBox off, and applied the new Tech Armor protector.  Good instructions and it comes with everything you need.  I still have a couple of bubbles underneath the shield, but I don't know how that can be avoided.  It is a huge improvement over the Otterbox protector.
0.9997448	0.8912608	This screen protector performs exactly as the seller describes.  It  provides excellent protection for my touch screen and keeps it looking clean and clear. The screen is very clear, the colors are vibrant and I have no problem manipulating the touch screen feature.  This is an excellent product.
0.9000052	0.6318326999999999	The posting service was fast and efficient. The price is reasonable even though I did find something similar and cheaper in TJ Max but this is still good!
0.99195397	0.8150752	I bought this because the one that came with my Otter Box never sealed correctly (my fault). I am really happy with this cover, though. It greatly reduces fingerprints, especially in frequently swiped areas, and it's easier (albeit not perfect) to see the screen in bright sunlight. I would definitely recommend this to others.
0.94893193	0.61992806	Ppl can still see what you are doing.needs more work.  Great for as screen protected .  Still needs work:( ???
0.85451746	0.73115003	Great product!  A few bubbles at first but, if you press hard enough with the soft towel it brings, they go away.  Be very careful putting it on, it only brings three.
0.9942211999999999	0.81410015	I was a little nervous after reading about all the problems some reviewers said they had getting this screen protector on properly. Because of that, I carefully read all the directions and watched the video at their website. I followed all the rules and applied it flawlessly the first time. So far, I'm impressed with the look of it on my phone and its performance. Very happy with this product, especially considering I got three screens for about 7 bucks.
0.99887025	0.8502324	Awesome screen protector thin and crystal clear and it comes with three screens with everything u need even a card to even it out great consideration. Also customer service prolly the best ever. Hats off to these guys. Completely RECOMMEND.
0.14118907	0.513617	Had a hard time applying this and tried a couple of times with the . I thers prior to giving up and paying full price for a non-glare screen protector from AT&T. I would not purchase this item.
0.44905078	0.5534121999999999	Why should I have to stand in my bathroom with the shower running to keep lint off the screen saver.  So I take my very expensive iphone into the bathroom and expose it to steam?  Come on - and try putting this junk on without problems such as air bubbles and of course lint spots.  I have  used better products than this and I didn't have to go into the shower to make it work  What a joke!So I read that customer service is great - after email correspondence and the promise of replacement, I never received it.  Ya, great customer service - NOT.
0.93425447	0.73056316	I've never applied my own screen protector before. I got it on my second try and installed one for my friend successfully as well. It does not mess with the phone's resolution at all and it has protected my screen from numerous scratches (as seen on the little scratches on the protector itself). Definitely recommend this to fellow iPhone 5 users!
0.9231142	0.76123714	Great screen protector. Reduces glare. Only bad part is when wearing polarized sunglasses screen has a bluish tint. Also since it crystal clear fingerprints do show but a wipe with a microfiber clears it right up.
0.012227118	0.19178519	CRAP is really all i can say; any dust will stick to either side of this bad material please do not buy this!
0.99299306	0.80382085	Good seller, fest shipping, great product. If I only could align this protector perfectly on the screen, I wouldn't even notice there is something on. I'd say there is no deference between bare screen glass and this protector visually, in touch and quality of view. I love it and definitely go with it again.
0.8645767	0.5099125	Just recommend to watch the video before you put the protector screen on your phone it shows you step by step how to do it VERY HELPFUL!!!!!!!!!
0.09322584	0.39210284	i ve seen a lot of privacy screen on phones ( specially when i used blackberry) and you literary can't see anything if you are sitting on the side, but this one besides it changes the look of your phone from a white iPhone to a black iPhone, whoever is sitting beside me can still see that I'm looking at photos, of Facebook or messaging, but they can't read. not doing the job
0.0047743917	0.34734547	I was not able to stick the screen protector on my iphone without any air bubbles. I gave up after several tries. What a waste of money...
0.9976404000000001	0.84459484	I received an email from Tech Armor with directions and link to a video before the product arrived so application was relatively easy.  The surface feels like silk and hardly ever needs cleaning.  Very happy with this screen protector so far.
0.98515815	0.8699434000000001	Great screen protector.  As with all matte style protectors, the clarity of the retina display is diminished slightly. These protectors are much better than others I've tried, because it's not a colored pixelation (which I hate most of all). I am a big fan of clear screen protectors, but hate fingerprints and smudges and have to clean my screen constantly. These are antifingerprint and keep my screen looking clean throughout the day. As for the anti-glare, I have had no problems reading my screen in daylight. Also, the install was a breeze. The few tiny bubbles I got on the first try all easily pushed out and the protector fit perfect. You can't get a better deal on a good quality protector. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase.Update: Downgraded to 4 stars because Acase antifingerprint screen protector beats this one.
0.97976834	0.8096325	Does just what it says, fits iPhone 5 perfectly. Was easy to put on and can hardly see it's there.
0.18178657	0.4532625	Easy to install, completely invisible, doesn't peel with the case I used.Great value, with these out there you should never be spending $20 on a screen protector.However the Galaxy S3 version was too big and a big disappointment.
0.371601	0.5290129	Very easy to install and practically invisible.  Those who give this a bad rating because the stickers don't come off are either not following or understanding the directions.  There are two outer layers that protect the actual screen protector.  Those are removed by pulling on the stickers.  They act more like handles when separating the layers.
0.9801485000000001	0.8198538000000001	Put this on my iPhone 5 a month ago and it has been doing a great job of protecting the screen. The tactile feel of the protector is good, not too sticky but still has a good resistance on the surface, fingers slide easily. A good and cheap 3 pack of protectors, highly recommended.
0.94686306	0.82187265	"I love these protectors. Quick installation - no air bubbles, lint, or dust on the first try. One tip of advice would be to make sure the bottom edge is aligned. Mine ""veers"" to the right a little. If I ever have to use the 2nd or 3rd protectors, I'll be a little more careful.I previously installed some Phantom Skinz screen protectors on my iPhone 5. While following their instructions to remove air bubbles with their supplied ""credit card"" - I ended up scratching the film, which didn't heal and was right down the middle. They also suffered from the ""orange"" peel effect. I will never look back.For the price, you you get a great value. Stop looking - buy this protector."
0.99201185	0.85309064	This is exactly the kind of screen protector I was looking for!!!  I have had many different screen protectors before and most of the were impossible to put on correctly, lrt alone get all the bubbles out.  Usually had to use 3 before it looked decent.  This one is crystal clear for my iPhone 5 and it doesn't take anything away from the crystal clear retina display. You cant even tell that there is a screen protector on my phone!!  The best part of all is that it went on flawlessly with one try...and I have 2 left!!  The price is the best around and the speed of delivery was awesome.  If anyone is unsure about this product and this seller...don't be.  You will be pleased!!!
0.41572726	0.3306583	The screen protector is matte not clear but matte so know the difference and I hate it cause it make everything look kinda blurry
0.8293165000000001	0.7044991999999999	Definitely recommend this product. When first applying this screen protector, I was glad that it came with a little card but it was too small, so I just used a credit card to cover the entire width of my iPhone. Also, I had to throw away one because I took a little too long to apply it to my phone, which was my mistake because I took off the protective layer completely then thought I could apply it directly on my phone, big mistake(dust accumulated because I had it sticky side up, so when I tried applying it, a LARGE amount of bubbles came up, I tried getting rid of the dust by using tape but it didn't work thus making it useless). The second screen protector, I peeled off a little bit at the top(about half an inch), aligned it with my phone, then continued peeling while simultaneously using my card to get rid of air bubbles. In the end I'm VERY satisfied with this product, there is no glare, the screen does not look any different than before so there are no quality issues with picture/video viewing. Although, I did drop my phone in between two couches and it landed on the floor, when I finally was able to get it out from under I had a one-inch scratch on my phone, subtle but there. But hey, at least it protected my actual screen right? That's what it's for. Ultimately I'm completely satisfied with this product and will purchase again and recommend to other iphone users.
0.026431202999999997	0.5859219	I is a piece of plastic that shows glare and finger prints. HD must mean has dirt. Way pay more for clear plastic sticker if its not better than the 1 protectors
0.9961803	0.8303780000000001	Great screen protector. My wife and prefer this over our previous screen covers. These are much better than the ones we got from best buy at 17.99 $ for 1 screen protector.
0.37813282	0.54487294	Not easy to put on...wasted 2 of them but last one worked great!  Would but again when I need more.
0.9893538000000001	0.7146229000000001	I needed these quickly and that how they came!  No more worries about my new phone getting scratched with these!  Thanks!
0.71097505	0.6764846999999999	"I originally purchased a screen protector from another company and it was flawed.  I started to go through the process of exchanging it online when I came across the Tech Armor screen protectors.  They come three in a pack and include tape to get dust off and a ""squeegee"".  When I put mine on, it was a little off centered so I pulled it back and tried again.  I figured I had ruined one!  No, it went on smoothly and flawlessly.  I followed the included directions and had no problems at all! No bubbles and you can't tell there is a protector on it.  Needless to say, i gave up on the more expensive, flawed protector to go with the Tech Armor.  The only complaint I have is that it shows every fingerprint and can get dingy looking.  I just wipe it down when that happens.  Oh, and it came FAST!"
0.8377162	0.38540602	Haven't used them yet because phone case came with screen protector. Nice to have them to use as spare screen protectors.
0.9280392	0.6953611	Very good product. I suggest this item for all people that are looking for this kind of protector.This item is very easy to work
0.98727083	0.7564241999999999	good product, great price.  This product had some good reviews vs the zagg which is what I was comparing it to.  It went on simpler than a zagg and appears to be a much clearer product.
0.95227844	0.7647234	Had no problems with bubbles at all, but maybe a little with dust.  This screen is the best I've ever used.  It is truly HD-like, does not affect the look and feel of the touch screen, almost as if it is not even there.  I had several people also tell me that they didn't know I had a screen protector on.
0.768922	0.45168933	amazing screen protector. i was not always the biggest fan of screen protectors but i thought i would give it a chance. im glad this was the one that i went with.
0.65420014	0.6020913	Unlike many other screen protectors, this product comes with all the key items you will need for a clean, bubble-free application:- Lint-free dust cloth for wiping down (don't try to use your own towel because there will be lint)- Dust cleaning tape that you can use to pick up what dust has already accumulated on your screen (when glass cleaner and wiping is not enough)- Plastic card to push out air bubbles- Multiple protectors in case you mess one up and need to try again
0.06959179	0.43743473	I honestly find it hard to see my own screen unless I turn on the brightness of my phone all the way up. I also have noticed that my touch screen is less sensitive to my touching, meaning I have to either press on letters several times or press harder on them. One last comment... I had the idea that it would completely not allow the person to the side of u see anything but its still somewhat visible. The screen makes more a small grid on your screen which makes the iPhone 5 screen look way less HD.
0.98933405	0.6787806	Great product at a great price. Ordered and had it the next day. Could not be any happier with this purchase.
0.93921524	0.7408973000000001	This screen protector is 10x better then any other one I've had, my screen feels great with it on and looks so clean, I got it with only minor air bubbles but then I just lifted it up a little bit a few days later to pull out the lint and now it's bubble free, you basically drop it on the phone and it seals itself its the best
0.95831096	0.7109411999999999	I had a Tech Armor before this one, unluckily the screen got scratched by my key, it saved the screen of my phone so I decided to buy it again. For some reasons it is kind of hard for me to apply the protection, when I tried other brands, I couldn't get a perfect one. However for Tech Armor I just got it right in one shot! I don't know if Tech Armor developed a technology for easy application or not, anyways it got my brand loyalty, next time I'll only chose this brand. High quality makes my satisfaction towards this kind of products. Cheers!
0.9952479	0.80533075	Came earlier than expected and were very easy to install would recommend them to everyone and the price is awsome amazon is so much better when it comes to price these same ones were about 30$ at a local retail store
0.9923105	0.8279585999999999	I have tried multiple screen protectors for my iPhone, and this is by far the best.  It is really easy to apply and it significantly reduces fingerprint smudges.
0.9971874	0.8151832	I have these screen protectors for two different iPhones and an iPad mini.  I have been happy with them since day one and plan on ordering the same if I ever need replacements.  Fit is great, install is easy, they hold up very well.
0.95802546	0.73746496	This works as advertised and I'd recommend it.  My only complaint would be that it does affect the clarity of the screen a tad -- but not dramatically.
0.75140166	0.5357001	This was a really good buy. I liked the fact that three came in the pack, just in case you messed up.
0.0014604032000000002	0.536011	I used two already and it destroyed the screen..so I stopped... I really thought it was a fraud. I paid $6 plus and it isn't worth it!
0.3633022	0.25841624	I purchased this item for my nephew so I can't give an honest review of this product.  I do know that I will not go without a screen protector on my phone.  They truly protect your screen from any damage.
0.5360689999999999	0.39057547	I tried multiple times to get these to go onto my wife's iPhone 5 yesterday.  I finally gave up.  I think we will take the phone to the mall and have them put on a screen protector at the screen protection booth.
0.98376954	0.72967005	This screen protector does exactly what iit is supposed to. I am very happy with it. I am glad it came with 3, becasue I accidentally messed up on the first application, and had to start over with another one. It does change the way things look, to a matte finish, but I am ok with this. I like to sit outside and play my games, and can see much better with this anti glarre protector. I will definitely buy again.
0.998791	0.8170351	Comes with very clear and easy to use instructions. Screen protectors are easy to install and fit perfectly.  Well done.
0.94452834	0.6221605	I prefer matte screen protectors (dont look so dirty & slimey). This one is doing the job well. Stays in place.
0.9838646999999999	0.7689031	Works as expected..very easy to get on as long as you follow the instructions properly.  I can barely tell it's on now.
0.98279846	0.7465491	Was easy to apply. I love the matte finish. Much better than the protector that came with my otter box commuter case.
0.98961526	0.82457	I have tried many screen protectors over the years of owning an iPhone, and I have to say this by Tech Armor is the BEST yet.  No sticking to itself and no bubbles during, or after, application.  I am also very happy with the way it cuts down on the glare - I can actually see the screen in the bright sun.  Great product!
0.96637094	0.81311136	I have had several different screen protectors for my various devices and these are the best by far.They come with everything that you need to apply them, though as an extra step, it might not hurt to have some canned air too. They went on really easy and truly look just as good as the retina displays I put them on.I messed up the first one by putting up my grubby finger on the inside as I was trying to center/clean under it. I put the second on on my phone with little issue and the third one on my wife's with even less effort.If you have a naked screen, dress it up with one of these bad babies.
0.6930334	0.5621792	I installed the screen protector soon after getting the iPhone 5.  Followed the directions and it went on smooth as silk on the first try.
0.9364252000000001	0.71490216	Protect your investment!!! And why not get rid of that annoying glare while doing it. Looks great and protects the screen. Win Win situation.
0.9915550999999999	0.8093427	This stuff went on really easily, absolutely no 'bubbles'. I was shocked at how easy and perfectly it went on. It was worth 3 times what I paid for it! I will absolutely buy again!
0.92989445	0.7691097	Works well for the price and seems to be holding up pretty good after a couple of months use so far.
0.97373617	0.8237718	Have had the product on for about 3 weeks now.  Protects well and has shown zero signs of coming off.  Very easy to install and much less expensive than some of the competitive products out there.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.
0.82745886	0.7706445	I love the privacy and the fact that the screen protector is thick. Not like others that start peeling off after a couple of weeks. Would highly recommed it.
0.98449576	0.84239423	I have had theTech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty for Apple iPhone 5 [3-Pack] on my iPhone 5 and it works great! There is no issue with touch sensitivity on the screen and it does not smudge or smear with fingerprints. The phone screen is easily visible in full sunlight as well which is a huge plus.The cut outs fit perfect to the iPhone 5. The camera, speaker and home button are all cut very precisely which is nice to see that they took the time to make it specifically for the iPhone 5. Fairly easy to apply and pretty forgiving if you mess it up the first time. Make sure that you wipe the screen thoroughly with the microfiber cloth before applying and you use the included tape if there are particles under the cover.It worked so well that I gave a pair to my neighbors who have a 3 year old and a 1 year old. They love it too. Great product!
0.9842716	0.6993997	The product is very nice the guy that installed it really loved it he was impressed with the cover sheet the other products get scratches when installing thank you for a great product
0.9041103000000001	0.7297775	Does everything it says it does.  Keeps info on my phone private from prying eyes. :)Very simple to install too.
0.97487044	0.8146706	Look - it's a screen protector. Some will say you don't need one at all, and they might be right. But for me - I prefer an anti-glare finish than the super-glossy finish of the glass by itself. The other thing this little sheet does is change the friction coefficient just enough so that your finger doesn't stutter or stick to the glass at all. Makes movements real smooth - almost like it feels on the magic trackpad.This one went on real easy, didn't require any second attempts, and had no bubbles or dust flecks under it. Having three sheets in the pack is a bonus. Great price.
0.9713616	0.64858216	I ordered screen protectors for my iphone 4 and iphone 5 and even Samsung s3 there so easy to put on and have never have gave me any issues they work fine the best screen protectors around u dont have to use water to put them on like u do with some and take a risk of messing up ur device THIS IS THE BEST SCREEN PROTECTORS ON THE MARKET
0.8831591000000001	0.6927687	Very nice, extremely good value for money. The only thing is that you do not need three of these! One is enough!
0.9827627	0.7844850999999999	I was skeptical of screen protectors for the iPhone 5. The screen is so nice looking I didn't want to impair the resolution...this protector does not!Installation was a breeze and the info on the website help immensely.
0.9382454	0.7163662	Easy to install, just make sure that the screen is nice and clean before hand.  Just goes right on with out much effort.  Looks and feels pretty nice.
0.99320513	0.8575963	My family and I have owned several iPod touch and iPhones and I'm the one who always gets the job of putting on the screen protector.  I've tried different brands and of the half a dozen or so devices I've done, I've *never* gotten one right on the first try and usually end up going through several protectors before I settle on &#34;good enough&#34;.  When I saw that tech armor guarantees their product and will replace it even if I'm the one that messes it up, I figured I'd give them a try.  I watched the video - which was very straight forward - and followed their instructions and much to my surprise, not only did it go on perfectly but there's not a single bubble!  To be clear, I was surprised that I managed to get it right as opposed to being surprised that their product works so well.  :-)  I did have to use the supplied card to smooth the protector as it went on, but the protector itself is thick enough that it went on very smoothly.  Now that it is on, I can't tell it is there.
0.7578988	0.6969436	If you are looking for perfection with this product, it probably will not happen. First, the apple glass has imperfections to start.No matter how I tried, I could not eliminate some very small bubbles between the glass and the screen. You would have to look very closely with the screen dark to see them. However with the phone on and the screen lighted, you could not see these bubbles or detect that Tech Armor protective screen is in place. In conclusion, I am very pleased with the product and highly recommend it. If you follow the directions, it goes on with no trouble. Well worth the price.
0.4298665	0.5807743000000001	Went on the phone without a hitch.  Had a couple of air bubbles but the supplied squeegee took care of them.
0.7190852	0.5457179	Pretty much what i was expecting. Easy to apply and will keep your screen looking good. Come in a 3 pack so if one gets scratched up, you have 2 more waiting
0.97129804	0.7415275	I did blow through all three screens before getting the installation right, but once it's on, it does the job. No complaints so far.
0.0085608065	0.46105325	Unless the brightness is turned all the way down which makes the screen extremely difficult to see (even from the front) this privacy screen protector doesn't work.  You can still see what is happening on my phone from many different angles.  I guess it was a good attempt but it just doesn't work the way I was hoping.
0.16809739999999998	0.35096917	There's nothing bad about this product. I can't even tell its there, probably will never use all three, each screen protector is super durable
0.9985209999999999	0.822981	I had a similar holster for my blackberry and the tech armor is exactly the same thing. Low profile and not bulky. An added bonus is the kickstand for video viewing or music playing. I highly recommend this product.
0.9958416999999999	0.92441726	"After reading countless reviews and watching YouTube video reviews on privacy screen protectors, I finally settled on this one!When the reviewer demonstrated the 4 way angle of privacy, I was convinced. (Link: http://goo.gl/VhG6w ) Package arrived in a timely manner to my business. Lifetime warranty is a plus.Things you will need:- Tech armor privacy screen protector- Tech armor microfiber cloth and squeegee- Tech armor dust removal tape or scotch tape- Nitrile glove (This is for if you have sweaty hands like me! It helps prevents oils/sweat from touch the sticky side of the screen protector)- Isopropyl alcohol swab- A bathroom shower running on hot. (Yes, you read that right. The steam from the shower filters out the dust in the air)Here's my process on installing this screen protector in order.- Run your bathroom shower on hot, leave and close the door (Wait about 10-15 mins for steam to develop)- Once 10-15 mins has passed, put on nitrile gloves and set everything you need on the bathroom counter.- Wipe down the screen of your iPhone with a Isopropyl alcohol swab and let it dry.- Use the dust removal tape or scotch tape if you prefer and pat the iPhone screen down of any dust particles.- Peel the sticker that says ""remove me"" 1/4 of the way up of the screen protector.- Line the sides and the home button and continue to pull 1/3 then 1/2 on the way up until the whole protector is on.- Use the squeegee and start from the center and push any bubbles outward.- Wrap the microfiber cloth around the squeegee like a taco.- Continue to push any bubbles outward.BAM YOU'RE DONE!Note: if you have any stubborn bubbles, peel back the screen protector and use some scotch tape to dap down the particles of dust where the bubble is formed.The setup on my black iPhone 5 makes me feel safe and worry free of any drops, scratches and cracks.Currently I have a Ottorbox Commuter with my Tech Armor 4 Way Privacy Screen Protector on, it has no bubbles forming around the edges except my bottom left corner for some reason.Note that you have to put your iPhone power button head first when putting on the Otterbox if you want no bubbles around the edges.The only main concern is that I have a bubble on the bottom left corner of my screen protector and it won't stick down to my iPhone as well as the rest of the screen protector. It bothers me quite a bit due to me being a perfectionist.Conclusion: buy it and don't look back! :D"
0.9980141	0.8175627	It's definitely the easiest screen protector install I have ever done. Plus it is super smooth and keeps the screen quality. No bubble or bad lifting edges either. Highly recommended.
0.9731525	0.76870835	I bought these for mine and my wife's new phones, and not only are they reasonably priced they are very easy to install thanks to the handy squeegee.  Just start at one end and work your way to the other slowly, and you'll be pleased with the outcome.  No bubbles or anything!!
0.97325444	0.7055923000000001	good screen protector for iphone5. It is very fitable.And the price is good for 3 screen protectors. Recommend!I hope this product could be durable.
0.28356317	0.38987288	I feel is very hard to install the screen protector. wasted 2, and I try the last one still a little bubble.
0.9964356	0.94730926	I would recommend this privacy screen protector to any of my friends, and I have full confidence that they would be as pleased with the product as I am. I have had several screen protectors on my iPhone 4, ranging from normal screen protectors to privacy screen protectors.There are two main things you want to be aware of when buying a privacy screen protector:1. They will be thicker than a normal screen protector.2. They will dim your screen.With the protector from Tech Armor, neither of these are a major issue. Compared to other privacy protectors I've had, this one is much thinner, but it is still thicker than just a simple screen protector. In no way does it hinder the phone's ability to respond to my touch.As far as the screen dimming is concerned, this product does dim your screen, but for me that's a good thing. I often think the screen is way too bright and I am always turning down the brightness in my settings, even though I have my auto-brightness on. The change in the brightness is very easy to get used to. I bought this product for my girlfriend and within a couple hours of using her iPhone 4, she says she doesn't even notice that the screen is dimmer. Compared to other privacy screens I've had, this one keeps your screen crystal clear. I've had some that make the images on my screen fuzzy, but that is not the case with Tech Armor's.Like many privacy protectors, Tech Armor's is an anti-glare screen protector as well. You won't have to worry about accidentally blinding someone on the bus anymore (or yourself for that matter)! While all of this is nice and awesome, probably the most important aspect of this product, besides protecting the information on your screen, is actually protecting the screen itself. My phone is constantly being shoved into my pocket when I'm on the go and often times ends up in the pocket with my car keys. I have yet to see any mark on the protector itself, let alone my phone. I had a screen protector before that got all kinds of scratched up from this everyday wear and tear.Lastly, I would say I have more experience than most with putting the screen protector on my phone, regardless, I thought that this was a very easy application. The little kit that comes with the  screen protector is all you need. I would highly recommend using the dust tape they provide for you as it will leave your screen that much cleaner before applying the protector. It comes with easy directions, so if this is your first time putting a screen protector on your phone you aren't just left hanging.As I mentioned before, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to protect their screen and wants to protect their information from the prying eyes of nosey neighbors. It does everything it says it's supposed to do and I am beyond pleased with my product. If the need arises, I will be buying this product again.
0.14347613	0.54999155	as a privacy screen, this didn't prove to be as useful as i had expected. since it makes the screen a bit darker, i have to turn the brightness up. but turning the brightness up on my phone enough to comfortably use the phone makes it bright enough for the person sitting next to me to see what I'm doing (or read what I'm saying), which defeats the purposealso, screen quality took a hit
0.9715023000000002	0.8146821	I followed the instructions and it was very easy to install, I agree with a previous review that it is better to align the camera instead of the home button. Very clear protector, you can't even tell it is on. I can put my phone in my purse without worrying about the screen getting scratched by a zipper or by  my keys.
0.8855343000000001	0.65723777	What a fabulous product!  My photos and videos look so much better.  I've even had other people ask me what protector I'm using because they can tell the difference too.  Buy this product; you will not be disappointed.
0.9973358	0.8634949000000001	Considering for these same protectors at the local Walmart it is twice as much these are a great deal. Fits better than a few others I have tried and is very clear, highly recommended for the IPhone 5.
0.31447759999999997	0.532752	Like the screen cover overall.  Could be a little better quality.  Took it off within minutes of putting it on because it would not fit with my otter box defender case.
0.9556788	0.75490284	When applying screen protectors, I use windex to cover the glass then lay the screen protector on so I can maneuver it into place.  Then just use a credit card to squeegee out the bubbles/water.  They always go on great and this one was no exception.  I like the anti-glare feature especially when using in car for navigation.
0.199523	0.605791	The clear hard plastic fits snugly. It is not cheaply made and not bulky. Sometimes you can't tell it is on.
0.95146483	0.62725294	Love it it's delightful. Like summer days but with less head ache. No more creepers on this freaking phone lol
0.28673583	0.6382284	I received the product, and although the packaging indicated iPhone 5, the protectors themselves had incorrect cutouts, seemingly for the iPhone 4/4S. There is no hole for the light detector and the cutouts for the camera, home button, and ear section are askew, even with proper alignment (either starting at the bottom, lining up the home button, or starting from the top aligning the camera space). I suspect it was an unintentional packaging mistake.Otherwise the instructions are clear and the product is durable and easy to apply.
0.0074713826	0.52987164	really all it did was dull the screen from all angles and it was REALLY thick!!  I have already pulled it off and thrown it in the trash :(
0.99540067	0.79485714	I love the anti-glare. I have gone through a few different screen protectors and this one looks/feels the best. Great product!!
0.9909617000000001	0.8011621	I've been using the screen protector for about a month and I'm in love with the fact that it holds true to anti glare and anti fingerprint. Definitely will be ordering it again in the future.
0.06693098	0.41262309999999996	Very difficult to put on without bubbles or stray dust particles, even after meticulous cleaning and carefulness. I would suggest taking this screen protector to the apple store and having a professional do it.
0.86553633	0.8265728999999999	I bought these after trying out the matte, anti-glare version. I liked the touch and feel of that version, but the anti-glare material clouded the screen and shifted colors, especially when viewing the iPhone from an angle. The clear version doesn't have this problem; the screen shows through it unaffected. You will notice the occasional glare, and the clear protector does collect fingerprints, but I haven't found either to be a real problem. Using this protector is pretty close to using the iPhone with any protector at all.Each package comes with a cloth to wipe down the iPhone before application, and each of the screen protectors pulls off of a clear sheet with a tab. As with any product like this, it requires a bit of patience to apply the the protector and squeeze out all of the bubbles. If you have trouble applying one or get dust caught on on the protector, fortunately there are three in the package, and you can try again.
0.8793931999999999	0.8528408000000002	"Overall I'm satisfied with this screen protector.  It fits the phone well and protects the screen.  It was slightly difficult installing and I wound up ruining one of the protectors by following the instructions (Luckily they include 3).  You can't line up the screen protector with the left side edge, if you do that the home button will not align properly (at least in my case).  This protector has about a mm of the edge of the screen that is not covered.  Instead start at the bottom and try to align the home button with the cutout hole.  I have my Iphone 5 in an Incipio case and had no issues with fit using the tech armor protectors.I also appreciated that this protector didn't require me to spray my phone with water or cleaning solution to get it in place, I've used that style in the past and the bubbles are a nightmare and I'm always afraid of water damage. I was really surprised with the lack of bubbles I got while trying to install this, I only had two small ones near the edge of the screen that were easily removed with the squeegee card.  I've had it about a week now and it looks good as new.  My only complaint is fingerprints, I can't get the screen clean unless I'm using a microfiber cloth.  Using my shirt or a glasses cleaning cloth just smears the oil from your fingers across the screen.  I see that tech armor has a ""fingerprint"" resistant model, I'd be interested to give that a shot when this one starts to show signs of wear."
0.97198546	0.7516794	The installation was a little confusing since it says to remove Tab#2 but there is only one tab so that was my only issue. I love it because my fingers don't stick to the phone and when I am outside there is no glare from the sun!Great price for a great screen protector! Definitely recommend it!
0.32149523	0.4068219	Overall the screen protector works but it seems to leave some of the left side exposed. I used all 3 screen protectors because I thought I was applying it wrong but i got the same results all 3 times.
0.93158495	0.76971006	Just follow the detailed instructions for installation and it works fine.  You hardly know there is anything covering the screen.  Reduces risk of damage to screen, especially if you carry your phone in your pocket.
0.296603	0.61232585	I did not like this protector at all. The design is that you peel off the cover and start sticking it to the phone without having any grip. The cover is pretty hard and rigit and does not feel well in your hands. The windows are tiny and dont allow for any minimal displacement. I ended up discarding it and used the one that came &#34;free of charge&#34; as part of the case set. That one had 2 covering sheets: one you peel off and you still have another one with attached sticker that you can use as a grip for proper placement. It had a bit larger windows for the speaker and front camera so it was not difficult at all to mount it on the phone.However, the tech armor product had disappointed me very much.
0.95543313	0.8530112	I am very happy with this Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector.  It does just what it's supposed to, plus helps to avoid scratches on the screen.  Very rarely do I have to wipe it down because of finger prints.  I mostly do it to avoid germs.  But finger prints are not annoyingly noticeable at all, and no glare helps tremendously when I'm looking at photos and graphics, which I often do for work.  I definitely recommend this product!
0.65443796	0.603061	It's easy to stick the screen protector to the screen of my iPhone 5 by myself, and there are 3 pieces in the package.
0.98536444	0.8221690999999999	I got these for our iPhone 5s that we just bought a couple days ago. The first thing that trigger my interest is &#34;Lifetime Replacement Warranty&#34;. For some odd unknown reason, the screen protectors on our previous phone (iPhone 3s) seems to always fall off or start to peel after a few months of use. No clue why... And having to keep buying new screen protectors for our phones is just a PITA. There always seems to be so many different ones out there, and it's like hit or miss with most. But when I saw this, I though &#34;hey, why not?! If it starts to fall off or peel off our phones, I can just (hopefully) get a replacement and not have to buy new ones.&#34;I placed my order late Monday night, order was shipped the very next day and got to me on Wednesday afternoon. I immediately tear open the package and get myself ready to put the screen protector on.I used the cleaning cloth to clean off all the smudges on the screen, gently blow on the screen a couple times. Tried the first one on my phone, got a few specks of dust underneath it. But that's partly my own fault... I forgot to HOLD MY BREATH!. Tried the second one on my husband's phone, it went on with no problem whatsoever. So after practicing on 2 phones... I figured since I have an extra one, I might as well just try again on my own phone. And... WHAO-LAH! It went on smoothly with no problem at all. It's perfect!I am super happy with my purchase and I can't wait to tell all my friends about it. And oh! I also purchased 2 cases for the phones from the same company and got a discount on my total (not quite sure how that work out, but a discount is a discount!) So happy to have stumble upon this. Highly satisfied customer here!! =)p/s I did all this under a bright light. I think that really helps to see where the screen protector lays. So here is a piece of unsolicited advice -- do this under a lamp or do it somewhere bright. ;)
0.94020575	0.825559	"These are a good product for someone who wants a normal screen protector. They fit very well and are fairly easy to get on. I did an iPhone 5 and 4S and didn't mis-align either one on the first try. As for the protector itself, these do retain finger print smudges more than other types of screen protectors on the market. If you want to not have greasy smudges, go with a ""anti-glare"" type protector. They seem to do much better again finger grease and they also tend to allow your finger to glide a bit more smoothly.Overall: Great product and they came in a pack for three. Can't beat that.My opinion: Good for some but not for others fo reasons above."
0.9905644	0.752578	I love this product, but I stink at putting it on my phone.  I used up all three and managed to screw-up installation (in spite of watching their helpful video) each time.Most importantly, my screen is protected. I just wish that I was better at making it look good while being protected.
0.25017910000000004	0.66278934	The protector was easy to install and the privacy does what it says. however, the protector makes the screen look grainy. I'm not sure if this takes a few weeks to work out but I didn't expect this. other than that this is a good product for its price
0.8048539000000001	0.82467383	The product arrived right when it was supposed to, and came with the lint wipe, lint tape, and even a piece of cardboard to help with applying the protector. It went on easily and with almost no bubbles! My only thing is that the speaker and camera holes at the top almost covered the holes (it was cut too far to the left) which could have been a problem, but luckily they didn't end up covering the holes. The sensitivity of the touch screen isn't at all hindered by the screen protector either, and the 4-way privacy works incredible! Overall, love the product and especially the price!
0.98845375	0.7846513	These screens are amazing quality compared with products four times the price, and you get three screens instead of one
0.004585564	0.50520086	A protective film like these came with my phone, but the tabs that you are supposed to remove after installing the film stuck to it could not be cleanly removed.  I thought maybe they were old so I bought this product.  I tried installing all three of the films that were in the package and had the same problem with all three.  The tabs stuck to the film, removing them left a residue on the film in two cases and would not come off of the third.  Not to mention that I was unable to remove all of the bubbles.  I installed a similar product on my old iPhone and had no trouble at all.
0.93724865	0.7425114	Great screen protector for the price. I accidentally put the first one on the wrong side (doh!), but would recommend this product.
0.9991623	0.8504839	The Tech Armor i-Phone 5 screen works great and was super easy to apply.  I have always had difficulties gettting the screen protector on without lots of air bubbles, but this one went on really easily.  super nice product - I will definitely buy tech armor products again.
0.04266742	0.40403223	I purchased this item hoping it would be a great investment to keep my iPhone screen safe, but much to my surprise the item SUCKS! First off it doesn't really fit my screen properly. I got the first one on the first try and it looked decent so I just left it alone. The ear piece cutout gets filthy! It catches everything and there's no way to clean it. Secondly, the edges pop up so easily and get stuff under them which then makes the screen protected useless. Lastly, it gets scratched so easily. I've never been one to put my phone in my pocket with anything else. Never have never will. Regardless, the screen protector shouldn't get scratched up as easily as it does. I'm worried that it will get scratched all the way through and then scratch my phone. These protectors were a terrible investment and I am completely dissatisfied!
0.9990015999999999	0.81231385	And in this case, I'm very happy.  Was a fraction of the cost of what Best Buy offers, went on easily, bubble free. No problems.. Glad I bought it,and would do it again.
0.7038746	0.70446396	It may be me but I always seem to trap too many bubbles when applying these protective covers to electronic screens. These bubbles have absolutely no interference at all when using the Iphone, Ipad ,or any variation of this type touch screen. You really only see the tinny bubbles when the screen is black.
0.99652123	0.8321662000000001	"After purchasing a single screen protector at a local ""big box"" store for 3 times the price of the Tech Armor protectors, I tried these and have been very satisified.  Great product, great price and shipping was very quick."
0.9153831	0.68893576	I have installed 9 Tech Armor screen protectors on family iPhones.  Only once did I have to toss the whole thing and start over.  And none of the 9 have bubbles, thanks to the dust removal tape.
0.9995209	0.91981685	No fingerprints - YES!  Easy to apply, no glare, great Retina Display viewing.  I highly recommend this product by Tech Armor.
0.7181809	0.59384745	The screen protector itself is excellent but it is smaller than the whole glass front of the phone so some little parts of the phone stay unprotected. Easy to install and you can rinse with water to reinstall if you failed.
0.9855075000000001	0.7945746	This is so much better than the one I'd purchased at store with my last phone. Cannot see all the fingerprint and makeup smudges now. Love it!!!
0.8013442	0.69455034	Thought it's one of those easy to scratch protector.  But after using for a month and so still pretty clear of any scuff marks at all.Nice!!
0.031741768	0.36167550000000004	Followed instructions, pretty good with instructions AND I watched the video. The cardboard squeegee lets this product down big time. Leaves lint like particles around the edges when squeezing out bubbles. Meant I had to lift to clean causing smudges on the screen guard. Kind if a waste of time cycle...Feel I wasted my time and money
0.9778546999999999	0.74905205	I just put this on my iphone 5, and yes, it took a couple tries because ALL screen protectors suck to install, BUT, it looks great now.  The clarity of my phone is still perfect and now my screen is protected.  Yaa!
0.9940952	0.8689370000000001	I have used other screen protectors in the past.  These are easy to apply (if you follow the directions) and they really work.  No bubbles or other issues and I'm still on my first of the pack after several weeks.  It's easy to wipe fingerprints off, and the screen protector does not interfere with the iPhone 5 functions in any way.  A great purchase.
0.8860725	0.59626263	This was a low cost way to cover your IPHONE 5 Phone with antiglare screen. I would recommend this for anyone with an IPHONE 5
0.9849968000000001	0.7628115	i love tech armor products! i have the privacy screen & now i ordered these & they're just like they described! anti-glare & anti-fingerprint.
0.23750725	0.5704962	Although the privacy is nice it takes away from the crispness of the picture. I don't think I'll buy again.
0.5371069	0.63406336	Now I know why they give you 3! The first two attempts ended badly, but the third was the charm. I don't live in a vacuum, so there are two small dust spots under the film, but that's not bad. The trick for me was using the [included] dust tape on the phone before putting the film down. I also couldn't get the card to actually smooth out the bubbles, but my fingers did a good job. Now that it's down, I actually like the feel of the tech armor better than the glass. And it's better protected from the kids...
0.9926746999999999	0.7849022	Super easy to apply and holds up well. I have had trouble in the past with other brands but this one is exactly as described.
0.20333087	0.6183681999999999	The directions tell me there should be two pull tabs, labeled # 1, the other #2.  I don't have that.The set I received only has one pull tab, and no number, with the words &#34;Remove Me&#34; in blue ink.In very small print, written: &#34;Peel off this sticker and the attached protective layer, not just this small sticker&#34;.Do I guess now?  Is the sticky side the one with the &#34;Remove Me&#34; or might there be a three layers but my set just didn't get the the #1 , #2 tabs?  Is the &#34;Remove Me&#34; side the side that's suppose to face the phone, or is it suppose to face to the outside?Do I indeed have three layers stuck together, or just two?  Looks like two.  If I do have three layers how do I get the one off when I don't have a pull tab?  Use a needle, pin?  Web-site was of no help
0.9970836	0.78245974	Fantastic product. They provide the utmost help in applying it, they even have videos. I had problems applying it because I'm a dutz but I emailed them and they sent me a replacement for my troubles! I eventually was able to apply it and it looks great and it really is protecting my screen. I have an iPhone 5C and it fit well. Thank you and do recommend!
0.7856325	0.6632526999999999	Easy to install and easy to remove, no solutions to apply, no bubbles, you don't even feel it's there cause there is no air space between the protector and your iphone screen hence no rainbow effect like the competition (just what I have with my iPad, very annoying) and for a way much much cheaper prize and to top it all, they give you three screens to use/try on. Unfortunately, it did not work well with my glide case, as much as I would love to, that's why I messed up the first two screens trying to fit it in and work with the glide case but no can do, just too tight, so I decided to do some trimming for the last available screen at hand to make it really work cause I really want to have this screen protector on, love the sensitivity of my iPhone with it and again no bubbles no rainbow effect, but unfortunately, the sides did not stick well  probably because I tried three attempts installing it, did not trimmed it well the first two, but the rest of the screen were perfect, that's why I left on. It's not that recognizable anyway since I have the white iPhone unless you really will look at it intensely, that's why it's still there on my iPhone 5 as of this writing and not planning to remove it at all, am loving it, I like the sensitivity and feeling of protection to the screen, safe from scratches.  And if ever am gonna replace my glide case in the near future, no doubt, am gonna order this screen protector from Tech Armor at  Amazon right there and then. Highly recommend this screen protector to anyone not using a glide case to their iPhones.
0.98504496	0.7185598000000001	Product works as it should and was easy to install. Very few bubbles and I'm happy with the product. May buy again in the future
0.9550818000000001	0.81521946	These are hands down the best screen protectors for the iPhone 5 in this price range. They are easily applied and have a true matte finish. I have had a lot of protectors that claimed to be &#34;Anti-Glare&#34; and &#34;matte&#34; finish, but they never truly are. They also hold up very well. I've only replaced it due to my child scratching it with something and I'm anal. This protector truly lives up to all of its claims. I will continue to stick with this brand as long as possible.
0.9953692	0.80931765	I needed some new covers for my iphone 5. I had the original I bought when i bought my phone, about 8 months ago. After putting it on, I feel like its a whole new phone. Make sure you watch the video as the installation is specific. Use the dust tape, that stuff was great and I have no bubles with a pefect installation. And for the price, I was very skeptical. Very good buy!
0.99881697	0.8796033999999999	Following the instructions, the Tech Armor screen protector was very easy to install. It fits perfectly and the look and feel are almost like it's not there. I saw no change with the screen resolution. Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend it.
0.9915686	0.6893369	Great service. Great product. I would definitely do business with them again. The product is exactly what they said it was.
0.8377749	0.7005207	I have tried many shields over the years of smartphones. Previously, ZAGG shields, when installed correctly have been the best and to some extent still are in terms of ease to instal and actual protection [...]. However, to get a feeling as close to glass as this while protecting my phone is awesome. I know a few snobs where i work that prefer to risk their screen without a shield because they like the feeling of the unprotected glass. This is the first time they were impressed and interested in buying a shield. For look and feel while protecting against scratches, this is the shield. For actual protection though from drops and cracks, I would still tell those people to look at ZAGG products.
0.9641249	0.76901287	These are great screen protectors. You don't have to clean them very often, and they make your screen look clear.
0.9962853000000002	0.74206924	this is a must have for any phone. easy to use. offers great protection and is very affordable. again its a MUST HAVE!
0.78215194	0.7505261	I have tried many different screen protectors for my phone and these are the best by far. I have ruined several other ones attempting to put them on and due to poor quality I always had bubbles.  These are very high quality, no bubbles, and I installed first try in less than 2 minutes.  Only protectors I will ever buy now.
0.009994209	0.41765696	Buy another brand. I tried to install on my dust-free brand new iPhone5, all 3 attempts (I was very very meticulous) resulted in 1 or 2 micro dust pieces under the protector which created a nasty looking bubble and runied it. My money is wasted!
0.76901597	0.49608085	It seems like an awesome product but I have troubles with it since I used all three and I still have bubbles.  It's not that I am bad at putting it on, I got one for my iPad and it was just fine on the first try, but for my iPhone 5, I'm having trouble.
0.97883034	0.7234451999999999	Must buySo easy to use!!!!Can't even feel that it's thereI'm so happy I got this for my new iphone
0.9939781999999999	0.76286507	Overall, this is a great product! It was shipped and packaged with care and I am really happy with this screen protector. I have had it for about two weeks and it is like there is nothing on my screen. It is very resistant to scratches, which was what I was looking for, and I am very pleased.
0.8312378	0.75785494	The screen protector is great and does exactly as Tech Armor advertises. There is no difference between the quality of the image displayed with and without the screen protector. I had no issues installing the product on my iPhone 5, directions were very clear. I know Tech Armor doesn't advertise the screen protector as oleophobic, however, that is my one complaint with this product and why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The screen protector gets very oily compared to the naked iPhone 5 display. It can also be difficult to clean off the oil.Conclusion:Great product and I would recommend it to my friends, however, the screen does get oily with the screen protector.
0.79142046	0.8185717	Product is as described. Minimal air bubbles when applying the screen protector but the ones that showed were small and easy to remove with their included remover. The screen protector was easy to be applied. However, I found that after applying it the exact size of the screen protector was not as wide as the actual screen for the iPhone 5. I was also a bit disappointed that the cut outs for the camera and microphone were a bit larger. These were minor problems and the overall screen protector was great. One of the major issues I have with this screen protector is the fingerprints that it attracts. I was going to buy the matte screen protector but I did not want to lose the screen quality. I wish that they could make the screen protector a bit more resistant to fingerprints. The screen protectors are definitely recommended to anyone who wants protection for their iPhone's screen without hindering their screens performance.
0.9996132999999999	0.79716605	First of all, I think it's awesome that this company is offering lifetime warranty on their screen protectors. Easy and simple installation and great, precise, cut outs. Highly recommended!!
0.10143179	0.47488257	The screen protector was cut a little off meaning that the speaker hole at the top was further to the right so it never was able to line up properly. Beyond that it makes the screen harder to see. The only way to describe it is it dulls the picture and adds a slight shimmering effect very wierd. I would not buy again. I am now using the Spigen GLAS.t SLIM Premium Tempered Glass screen protector. 1 word to describe. AMAZING! Dont waste your money on anything else. I am sold on this company at this point they have the best case and the best screen protector for my iphone 5. Never going back to low quality junk.
0.49147879999999994	0.49303854	good product it's just hard to get all dust off screen before laying down protector which results in a couple bubbles, but that's not the products fault.
0.33387738	0.33116043	Package has step by step installation which is very helpful. I didn't expect to get the matt screen (not sure there was an option when I ordered it) but it looks fine.
0.9764075999999999	0.72852755	The step-by-step instructions along with all the necessary tools (squeegee, cleaning cloth, dust removal tape) allowed me to apply this screen cover without any trouble on the first try!
0.9984969000000001	0.7763441	I more than love this product!! And with as much as I love the product, I love their customer service even more!! They really want every bit of of your time spent installing and owning this product to be a positive one. AND IT IS!! It works great and you can't even tell its on my phone!
0.15500697	0.3791071	I thought they were awful. Messed up with the first one. The second one bunched up when my husband put it in his pocket! So no need to use the last one. Ordered some new ones. Will see how they work.
0.9930604999999999	0.87323624	"Some of my friends have Android phones and are quire jealous that this screen protector isn't available in their model of phone. It resists fingerprints like a champ and I don't have any issues with glare. I can't believe I didn't know about matte screen protectors until now. Definitely the best screen protector that I've used to date.Some notes... unless you have access to a sterile room to put this thing on, you will get dust underneath it as you put it on your phone. I recommend using scotch tape to get some of the loose dust around your ""work station"" as you put this baby on."
0.9939829	0.74566495	it was SO worth the price. i like how it really is fingerprint proof :) i would recommend this to anyone & you cant beat the price for getting 3 protectors in the case (: shipping was fast too. i got it earlier than the expected delivery date
0.45155138	0.65549225	I had trouble placing the first two protectors on because of user errors, then the third one went on smoothly. It is very clear and does not interfere with touch response at all. I did email customer support because I was not happy with how difficult it was to get prints and make-up oils wiped off. They replied within 3 hours to give me tips and such, but really I just did not like the smudging issue. They then offered me an anti-oils replacement set. I like it but I have sacrificed the clarity of the display. I hope to get used to it. I would have rated it 3 stars but customer service earned the 4th.
0.8702735999999999	0.5612887	The screen protectors bubbled and I don't like seeing the bubbles on the screen.The screen protectors need to go on more smoothly.
0.99777067	0.85913455	the worked perfect.  i would recommend this for any phone.. they are very sturdy screen protectors.  i would buy these again.
0.98461187	0.7318496	My order had been misplaced; however, seller was expedient and prompt. The installation is not as easy as the videos; however, once you get it one it is a great product. Really a reliable seller and very courteous would definitely recommend others to buy from them. Overall a great package comes with screen cleaner which was unexpected as well as a sticker to remove dust before installation. They really did think of everything overall a really neat produce. Very happy with my purchase.
0.9482943000000001	0.72509134	I was never one to use screen protectors, but in fear of my first iPhone, I decided to not take any chances! The protector is well worth the price, solid and thick!! Yet still keeping slim and no touch difficulties!! The privacy is alittle less then what I expected but no big deal. The top layer of plastic peeled within a month, I believe I just got a defective one. I emailed the seller and they replaced it no problem, so no worries there!!
0.98463875	0.8762368	I'm so very thankful for the reviews on Amazon.  I've purchased screen protectors before off the shelf of a retail store and it was a guessing game to see how the product will work when finally installed on my device.  I purchased the Tech Armor screen protector for my iPhone 5 based solely off of the reviews of others on Amazon.  I'm so glad I did.  Just like others have mentioned before, the installation process was easy and (no bubbles).  Sometimes I forget I have a screen protector on my phone, that's how good the product is. It blends in to the device.  The feel is great.  My fingers would not slide so easily with just the original glass surface of the phone, too clean I guess.  With the Tech Armor product sliding with my fingers is nice and smooth when I navigate on the phone.  I have not had to use Tech Armors customer service because the product was so easy to install and is holding up nicely.  I would highly recommend this product to all who have read this far.  You will not be disappointed.
0.9955924999999999	0.8684719999999999	These screen protectors are easy to install, and are barely noticeable once installed.  I liked these so much that after installing, I purchased the same product for my iPod touch.  Highly recommend.
0.98798764	0.76477593	Having done a few of these, I'm sure my technique is improving, but had to write this to say that this application is the best yet. No bubbles and no dirt on a brand new screen. Can't even tell it is there and the surface is just as shiny and flawless as the Gorilla glass itself.
0.9902337	0.8079006	They work well as described and my wife and I both use them. Would recommend them to whoever has a iPhone.
0.9759964	0.80414814	Everything advertised about this screen cover is accurate. I had no issues whatsoever getting the cover on my iphone 5
0.04452461	0.34950113	Not worth the trouble and frustration to install. Doesn't protect the screen, and discolors the screen. Buy the thicker ballistic glass from tech armor  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BT8L2MW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7
0.9992134	0.79877377	easy install looks great, works great, good product for the iphones or any other smartphone.  Have bought several types from tech armor, all are great protectors
0.71407855	0.6858673000000001	Goes on clear and are cheap to replace.  I like that they have protective coatings on both sides prior to installation.
0.801614	0.64083326	I gave it a 5 stars because the installation was very easy with no bubbles whatsoever. The product also arrived very fast, about 3 days before it said it would arrive. The only part that i did not like about it though is that the pre-cut  was a bit off for the home button. Other than that, I gave it a 5 stars.
0.8342093	0.7376789	This is my 2nd time buying these screen protectors.  I went back to the same vendor (Tech Armor) due to the quality of their product.  My first protector was actually scratched somehow so I had to get a new one - but the protector did in fact protect my actual screen from any damage so that was a big relief and why I think this is a great product.My only complaint relates to the lacking instructions for applying the protector.  The first version I purchased had clearly marked a 1 side and a 2 side to the screen so you knew which was to be removed first and applied to the screen and which side was to be face-up.  It was also not exactly symmetrical as it had a space for the sensor next to the ear piece so that helped at well.  However, this newer version is exactly symmetrical (which I like but contributed to my confusion the first time through) and the tabs are marked in much smaller numbers so I mistakenly assumed that it didn't matter which side I applied first.  Of course I was wrong the first 2 times I tried, not able to figure out what was wrong, but then had the &#34;aha&#34; moment the 3rd time and applied correctly.  So it was a bit frustrating, both because I should have known better, but because I felt the sides should have been more clearly labeled as the protector is wasted if you remove the wrong side first.Also, by no fault of Tech Armor, but just so buyers are aware, applying is not an easy process, not so much because of air bubbles being trapped but more so to line it up properly.  The first version I had I had to re-apply twice to get it exactly right where it wasn't slightly overlapping and sticking to the home button.So all in all, a great product.  Don't hesitate to purchase just be very careful and deliberate in applying and once that's done you'll be very happy.  It's a good thing they come in packs of 3 otherwise I'd be much more frustrated with myself and with the product.  I wish I had a few spare ones still, but when it's time for a new protector I'll be going back to Tech Armor happily.
0.17837623	0.602751	Does dim the brightness and hd feel to the screen, but does advertised. hard for someone who is not holding the phone to see what is displayed. Complete privacy. The feel is nice too
0.92135406	0.7927134	"I've installed several of these type of screen protectors (iPod touch, Droid, iPad...) and it always is an exercise in patience.  This is the very first time I had one go on perfectly the very first time.  Cleaned my desk with Windex, washed my hands, and then followed the video directions they have on their website.  Perfect!  Now I'm not sure how much protection these things provide but I figure it can only help against my keys or similar.  I really waffled between this and the glare proof version but settled on this because glare really hasn't been a huge issue for me.  My only gripe is that the cut out for the speaker hole and camera are about 1/4"" wider than they need to be and not centered on the protector.  My protector is installed straight but the speaker and camera are in the far left of a cut out that is too big.  Although not very obvious, it's just odd.  That said, I recommend this protector."
0.9937239999999999	0.7986648000000001	Easy to use.....works perfect!! Applying the screen protector was easy to do. Once I cleaned the screen and applied the protector I placed the device into a protective case to defend my phone as well as protect my screen.
0.9960648000000001	0.68916136	Covering works well.  Seems like it will last.  Satisfied.  I would purchase this again.Covering works well.  Seems like it will last.  Satisfied.  I would purchase this again.
0.49784014	0.5608774999999999	The instructions on line make putting on the screen saver a snap. Was trying to install these on my old cell phone and ended up screwing them up. Thanks
0.99926615	0.9026700000000001	This product is great. I love it. It perfectly fits the iPhone 5. It comes with instructions, dust tape, a lint cloth, a squeegee, and 3 screen protectors. I wasted my first one because I put it on upside-down (I know, genius), but I still had 2 left over. They were very easy to put on, and the dust tape and lint cloth made it so absolutely no dirt was left underneath. The squeegee prevented any air bubbles, and you can hardly tell I have a cover on my phone. It doesn't interfere with the camera, the speakers, the home button, or anything, it's very clean, it does not affect the sensitivity of the touch screen, and it's almost as if it's not there. The only difference is that now, my phone won't scratch. It arrived way before the estimated delivery date also, so I was very pleased with that. I would buy this product from them again, I have no complaints, and I would recommend this to anyone with an iPhone 5.
0.9979998999999999	0.8189916	I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a privacy screen protector!!  Would buy again!  Great lifetime warranty as well!
0.92814636	0.61598516	Product went on easy and was smooth and bubble free.  Works great and feels good on the screen.  Not sure if i really need 3 but may need a backup at some time
0.9707712	0.74043083	Perfectly described as it covers the view ability so anyone next to you cannot see the phone and it is smudge free
0.9685804	0.78461903	Three screen protectors at a good price.  Everything you need to apply them is included.  Hey, all screen protectors are a pain to apply so it's nice that these are priced low enough that you can throw one away when you mess it up!
0.99298656	0.81442165	I was so impressed with how easy the screen protector was to install. I purchased a different brand for my iPhone 5 from Best Buy originally, and I had a terrible experience. It was 3x as expensive for one protector, which I messed up and had to throw away. After reading multiple reviews on TechArmor I ordered this screen protector instead. I read the instructions carefully and watched the instructional video on their website. It only took one attempt for me to get my screen protector on perfectly. No bubbles, no dust, and it fits the screen perfectly. I would definitely recommend this company to others.
0.18675783	0.52997655	My only complain about the product is how it is cut. The ear hole and camera hole are not cut correctly and it looks like it is for the wrong phone. Also, for a thin slice of plastic, I don't think it was worth the value when I feel a product like this is a dime a dozen.
0.35614309999999993	0.6760841999999999	It's a PITA to get it on with no lint, but it looks great (as in, you can't tell it's even on there) when it's on the phone properly. The bubbles were easy to get out, but the lint was hard to get off if it gets stuck on the sticky side of the protector.
0.9952224000000001	0.7919921999999999	Very happy with the purchase of this product, it is exactly what was described on the page and the customer service was great!
0.07664564	0.62304497	bottom corners just cracked without being dropped or banged after only about 3 months. I liked the sleekness, and feel, but too cheaply made
0.74393153	0.41554624	I love it! I bought this to stop a friend of mind from looking at my phone and it worked she was unable to see my screen therefore she wasn't in my business. Made my days better &#10084;
0.9903806	0.64919275	Best value, I even forget it's there. Like it so much I'm ordering more for my friends. I especially like the HD clear screen because it eliminates glare!
0.5374948	0.7071316	I got a slight crack in my screen and this has worked well to keep it from getting worse. Did not degrade the tactile response of the phone in any way and it fit quite well. Includes a lint free cloth and a tacky sticker to ensure a clean surface and has a decent tool for smoothing bubbles.
0.98929715	0.71811855	This product is one of the best I have ever used. I had a hard time at first getting the protector on but once it was one, you can't even tell its there. They also have great customer service and was more than willing to help when I had a concern. I would definitely recommend this to someone else.
0.99953616	0.904623	I recently ordered the Tech Armor Screen Protectors for both my iPhone 5 and for my Kindle Fire HD. The screen protectors went on very smoothly, unlike some other brands I have used before. The matte finish provides and anti-glare and anti-fingerprint protection as advertised. Highly recommend this product.
0.62222004	0.81972015	I used to buy this cheap brand of protectors that would scratch up just from where my fingers went across the screen. Decided to give these a shot, and I love it. So easy to install and looks immaculate on the phone.BIG INSTALLATION TIP:When installing, go from bottom to top. Peel off the material to reveal just about an inch of the sticky surface to adhere to the phone. Line it up at the bottom, and using one hand, smooth it out while with the other hand, pulling the material covering the sticky surface away as you go up the phone.
0.9679154000000001	0.7506028	Came so fast! And work like a charm! No bubbles and no lint or dust got under it. Will be buying these again if i need them!
0.99847776	0.86032116	I love this screen protector! Easy to apply and it keeps the smudges and fingerprints off my screen! Would recommend.
0.25400048	0.58123285	It dims the screen and the holes for the camera and earpiece don't look centered. These are the one two issues and for this price you really can't go wrong. My phone looks fly as hell with the matte finish, too.
0.9946356	0.7362207	The product works excellent. Sticking the armor in a way that perfectly matches the iPhone screen wasn't easy at all (specially if you don't want any air bubbles). Besides that, I could't be happier with the product.
0.98505455	0.75964177	The best screen protectors you can get! They apply with ease.. no bubbles during the application and they last a long time!
0.9975321	0.80675733	I had a stock screen protector on until I ordered these and the difference is pronounced. It was easy to install and now I can't even tell i have a screen protector on my phone. Great Product and highly recommended.
0.91411805	0.69561833	I needed a screen protector for my new iPhone5. This was my 3rd iPhone, but i've never bought a screen protector. Also knew I should have one but was so afraid of bubbles, misalignment, etc.I  read the instructions, which were very clear. The instructions gave me reassurance because of all the promises that this company wants you to get it right and will support you, but i was still apprehensive. Like a Polar Bear Dive, I decided to go for it and just dive in. It ended up taking me less than a minute, and having read the instructions ahead and knowing what to do, and having the tools needed provided in the package, it ended up being very easy! My stress was for not. And honestly, my screen looks even sharper now . I'm so glad to have this over. It sat on my desk for a week with me staring at it. Now i feel silly. It really was so easy.
0.9920409	0.74753666	It is a screen protector after all and it is hard to distinguish between the vendors who provide good products.I bought this for my iPhone 5 when it first came out and have been using it ever since (never replaced)  It works great and recommend itl
0.95279896	0.69361925	I really liked that you got 3 screen protectors in this kit. I messed up the first and used the 2nd :) now I have an extra. It is very easy to put on your phone! They are not like the ZAGG shields where you spray and let dry they are a traditional screen protector. They work good!
0.78973186	0.5725185	There was an adhesive issue on one of my sheets and the company sent three replacements with no questions asked.
0.9457706	0.5470193	this is exactly what i was looking for. Make sure you know how to instal it correctly before you actually do
0.99680436	0.8407121999999999	I ordered these a few days ago and had some trouble with installation. I contacted the company and they happily sent me some replacements free of charge. GREAT COMPANY and high quality covers.Some suggestions when applying the covers:-Watch the online video on their homepage. These protectors are a bit different than ones I used before, and the video did a great job showing me how to apply them.-Let them warm before applying. I tried putting these on once the packaged arrived and they were very, very cold. My first attempt went awry, I think, because the adhesive was adapting to the change in temperature. Once properly applied, THEY WORK GREAT in cold temperature.I would happily buy more stuff from this company.
0.7977017	0.682159	This is a very, very clear screen protector and seems to be holding up well. However it took all 3 screen protectors to finally get one that was free of air, dust, and lined up well.
0.9951146999999999	0.8543873	This product is simply the best. I have been trying to find a screen protector that is both easy to install and actually does what its suppose to.I was able to install it on the first try with no problems, the instructions and installation material are really helpful. The dust remover tape is simply genius.All I can say is if you want an affordable screen protector that is easy to install this is the product you need!
0.99579483	0.82478124	Normally my screen protectors last for a very sort period of time. These are great! I love the matte finish and you get 3 of them! So far I'm on my first one and I have had zero problems. Easy to put on. No smudges that you see. Overall great project. Anyone that wants to protect their phone from scratches. This is it!
0.007381260400000001	0.23641708	Impossible to install without air bubbles.  Poor instructions.  I would not but this product ever. Plus it is way over priced.
0.79490703	0.7988751999999999	I recently replaced my iPhone 4 with an iPhone 5. I was constantly cleaning the screen to remove fingerprints. The Tech Armor screen protector has a non-glare matte finish that hides fingerprints. The privacy feature make the screen a little harder to see, but I just adjusted the brightness setting. I've gotten used to the look and I really like the screen protector. The privacy screen helps stop the rude habit some people have of looking at your phone.
0.9542997999999999	0.7786523	I found the cover to fit very nicely and with much patience I was able to get it on without a single bubble. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.If you want to take away completely from the Retina display of the iPhone 5 and essentially downgrade to an iPod touch 3rd Gen, then this is the screen cover for you!UPDATE:Tech Armor Support saw the review above and were very kind to provide me with 3 HD clear screen protectors that are just that. High Definition. It's like your iPhone is naked...Haha it's quite wonderful. The application was easy and fast. With the lifetime warranty I can't ask for anything more.I give it now 4 stars instead of 2 because although I don't like the matte screen protector, it's truly a nice product backed up by a solid HR department.
0.8076986999999999	0.7170813	I bought this to replace aSkinomi TechSkin - Apple iPhone 5 Screen Protector Ultra Clear Shield, AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon Wireless.  I liked the feel of the skinomi but it had rainbowing and seemed distorted in other places after a few days.  It just wasn't worth it to try and send it back (they also wanted the original packaging, who keeps that?).So far the tech armor seems great.  The first one had some dust under it so I used another.  The first one of the package also had some minor scratches, but I don't know if it's worth knocking stars off since you get 2 more in the package.I gotta say though, the dust cloth seemed to attract more dust than it pulled off.  I had the best success just using the tape to clean the screen.
0.60368717	0.56156516	I am so excited about this screen protector.  I had previously bought the HD version by Tech Armor and was very please with it except the fingerprints.  So I decided to give the Anti Fingerprint/Anti Glare a try and I love them.  I probably will never use anything different.
0.8100655999999999	0.6998925	It has only been a week, however the screen protector installed easily and has worked as advertised. I am happy with the purchase so far.
0.9907224	0.81140155	Got this protector last night was able to put on the phone in less than 3 minutes. Just clean the screen very well under bright light because any fuzz or dirt will cause air bubble and ur good to go. It fits the screen perfectly too! Highly recommend this product!
0.9480890999999999	0.8114319000000001	This is a great screen protector if you prefer the type that has a matte finish & repels fingerprints.  Your screen won't be as crystal clear as you like, but the reduction of fingerprints makes it worth while for me.
0.94562423	0.74903625	The screen protectors are a must. Cell phones have become almost a necessity for most  of us and this is  a great accessory to keep your screen from getting badly scratched.
0.9978965	0.8330699	I was skeptical based on the reviews of products like this. But, I am very pleased with the quality. It was extremely easy to put on the phone and it fit perfectly. I really like the double sided mask. I did it in the first try.
0.9584115	0.768065	I was sure to read over the instructions first as well as while I was installing the screen protector and had no difficulty.  Got it right on the first try!  Love the anti-glare, no-smudge finish!  Hopefully, it will last a long while before I have to replace.
0.42117107	0.49139225	It's a good product but the problem is when your iphone has been replaced by warranty you can not remove it and reuse... you need to buy another one!!!
0.97405434	0.8684120000000001	I wanted a durable screen protector that would still work well, preserving touch sensitivity on the screen.  These are easy to apply, do a great job of protecting the screen from incidental scratches from things like keys or coins in pockets, finger nails, or misc junk inside purses and backpacks.  The screens do not diminish the touch screen sensitivity / responsiveness at all.  Very smart choice for protecting your phone.  I have a three year old iPhone that looks like new because of these screen protectors.  I replaced the original screen protector after just over two years.
0.91025555	0.6329683	I got this for my daughters Iphone although she did not want it. After she had it on for a week or so she loves it. She says it does not get finger prints or smudges on the screen. Now her friends want to order them for their phones. Great product.
0.99755955	0.79204667	Pretty easy to put on. Might be easier without dog hair from three dogs floating around. Using the screen doesn't seem to affect the ease of the touch screen. Great product. Great price.
0.9901271	0.79772466	Worked perfectly! It protected my screen from unwanted scratches and bumps, just what is supposed to do. Nice one! Will purchase again.
0.90608835	0.79059076	Easy application and doesn't scratch. Had it for about 6 months, and I keep my phone in with keys, etc and still no scratches.
0.98699355	0.71138346	Great items at a great price. They work well with iphone and ipod. Cut to size as needed. Good turn around time. Thanks!
0.66652167	0.6497089	Before getting this screen protector, I had used invisibleshield. I must say that I like the texture of this cover much better. It's very smooth and the anti-glare is nice! Unfortunately, you can't have everything, as the anti-glare does cause a grainy look on the screen.
0.9815556000000001	0.8004657	When it comes to screen protectors for iphones, I am no newbee. I have purchased a various brands at various prices. The Tech Armor screen protectors were a decent price and had a fairly high rating so I gave them a shot. When they arrived, I immediately noticed that the cut outs for the speaker and front facing camera seemed off. I decided to install one any way. The screen protector went down without a hitch and without any pesky bubbles.The cutouts did bug me at first, so I reached out to their customer service. Their customer service replied to my email quickly and explained to me that the elongated cutouts were intentional, in order to not cover up the two sensors near the speaker and the camera. I was content with the explanation because it made sense to me. Where they exceeded all expectations is they sent me another set! I really appreciated the great service and will definitely be looking into Tech Armor's other products in the future.
0.97858965	0.7635944	This is the best screen protector ive had in my life! Even when I wash/wipe it off, it doesnt streak or scratch! Simply the best!
0.99146295	0.8794198000000001	These work great! I just recently ordered a new set for a friend and they have updated the setup o they are cut perfectly around the home button and the camera/speaker so the customer picture describing how they are not cut precisely is now false. Every time a friend uses my phone they ask where they can get a screen protector just like it in lieu of their clear ones. They are also wayyy easier to apply as opposed to the clear ones. It's only takes me a maximum of two tries to have a perfectly applied cover with no air bubbles at all. They also son't peel because it' a hard piece instead of the flimsy clear ones that the corners will start to peel over time. All in all I would recommend this to anyone! Great buy for $6.95!
0.81820846	0.7566463000000001	Ok yeah fast shipping and great lifetime warrantee and came with everything. However, I installed it perfectly with no bubbles and everything as I have done this many times. The screen has this gritty look to it and the resolutions looks lower. That bright beautiful retina display is gone and they even subtly warn you about this in the description. Would recommend other one (just premium clear).
0.70169187	0.59122956	It is a good screen protector. Though you have to be careful putting in on due to dust and what not, it's actually pretty neat.
0.67727554	0.5791029999999999	I had ordered an otterbox and the screen had a speck of sand or dust underneath it and I couldn't get it out.  I was scared the screen would get scratched, so I ordered a pack of these anti-glare, anti-fingerprint screens.  I like them better than the one that came with the otterbox.  I was able to get this one on the screen without any dust or sand sticking to the sticky side and all the airbubbles smoothed right out.  The price was great and they arrived earlier than expected.  I now have 2 spares in case I need them.  I thought I would prefer a screen cover that didn't stick, but now that I've gotten it to fit correctly without incident, I really like these anti-finger print anti-glare, as I'm not constantly having to wipe the screen.
0.9957591999999998	0.8521199	This seems like a pretty standard screen protector.  At least, I don't see any difference between it and the ones I've had in the past.  Except this one includes a little cleaning cloth, dust removing tape, and a little piece of cardboard for smoothing out air bubbles. They also have detailed instructions included, plus a link to their website with instructional videos and a number you can call for help.  I followed the instructions and it worked perfectly the first time, no air bubbles or dust trapped underneath.  Absolutely perfect.
0.9959276	0.7856152	Works great! Love the matte finish on it and it went on nice and smooth. Especially great for the price.
0.7923819000000001	0.7516843000000001	these are the 3rd screen protectors we've bought.  Not sure what's different but the sure went on much easier and with less bubbles than any other ones we've tried.
0.99254686	0.8100228	Very good quality. It fits my iphone 5S perfectly. Its price is much cheaper comparing  to the price of similar products at iphone store.
0.9880121	0.7689464	This item worked as described.  Easy to put on and durable.  I should have purchased more! I recommend this product and the seller.
0.86676997	0.7703203000000001	I still can't believe a plastic guard for atop your iPhone can provide so much protection - yet leaves enough dexterity for your fingers to actually manipulate the screen functions.This was preform cut - so it fit my iPhone 5 perfectly.  The static cling of it was more than sufficient to keep it in place.  I wish everything was as simple as this was to install on the phone.
0.9994685	0.83475316	Product is great.  It arrived very quickly and is definitely worth purchasing. Vendor shipped product quickly and it is exactly as described.  Would purchase again from this vendor.
0.9974402	0.86221206	I received my item ahead of schedule, thank you!!  There are 2 tabs on the protector that you gently pull on one to remove the plastic overpiece, so as to reveal the sticky side. It is not so sticky that would prevent you from lifting it in case you need to re-place it onto the screen! Gently place over the screen mindful of the perfect holes in the protector for the mic, camera and home keys.  Easy. And then pat down from center to outer edges gently and voila!  No bubbles, and the best part....no loss of screen sensitivity which I was very elated about!!  I can zip through on the touchscreen of the iphone 5, clear screen, as though there was nothing there!  Love it, very happy I chose this screen protector.  And thank you to Amazon for having it in its selection.
0.9758293	0.8078573	This screen protector goes on quick and easy.  No bubbles, and is very clear.  The only drawback is that it shows finger prints, but it is easy to clean.
0.97187954	0.74741656	Way cheaper than the ones that they sell at the Apple store, fairly easy to put on (if you read the directions), and makes the screen nice and matte.
0.9946944	0.84064716	Great quality protector.  Easy to apply.  Came with instructions and a tool to rub out the bubbles, afteryou apply the protector.  It is also nice to have two additional protectors to use after the first one isworn.Quickly shipped.
0.9871334999999999	0.7537898000000001	Had troubles applying my first set of covers, e-mailed Tech Armor about I was unable to make any of my covers work, so they promptly mailed me an entire new set so I could try again (and they attached helpful instructions). I think it's great that they were willing to replace the product because of my mishaps! Thanks, Tech Armor!
0.99880564	0.89442736	Excellent screen protector, especially for the money. I used to have a zagg one but it eventually needed replacing and I didn't want to spend the money to get it. I actually like this one better. It was easy to apply (which is rare for a screen protector), fits perfectly and has a great matte finish. It even came with a sticky pad to get excess dust off of the screen. 3 for $6 is a steal. I am very picky about this stuff and I would buy these again, no questions asked.
0.9990300999999999	0.8237530000000001	I'm 100% pleased with this business, this is a necessary item for mi wife's phone and mine, great quality and easy installation.My recommendation is 100+.
0.5755962	0.56301385	bit glossy ...other than that its ok i like it compare to other and  it is cheap  you goy nothing to lose
0.9251111999999999	0.6929223000000001	This screen protector was just what I was looking for it hides what I'm doing from others leaning over and looking and it has a smooth feeling to it .
0.9665548	0.74250054	On a daily basis, I review client sensitive documentation on my iPhone. This product works fantastic and at an extremely affordable price. I've recommended it to my colleagues and will do the same for you.Please keep in mind though, with products such as this one, the engineering behind the privacy screen heavily affects the screen resolution. If you are one that loves the retina display on your iPhone and do not wish to have it compromised, this is not the product for you. I give it 5 stars because this is a product that works as advertised.
0.9637747	0.7260466	Good delivery time, good packaging. Product is as good as shown in the description. Installation was simple and easy and the screen cover hasn't moved since.
0.9593458	0.7649191	if u want a clear screen protector then this is the product you wantits cheap and everything is included in the kit, instructions, sticky pad to clean screen, screen protectors each labeled,thick card to squeeze out the bubbles and a number if u really need advice in which they can help you over the phone..on how to use..the cut out is right and have no complaints.. installed first and did a perfect job on the first try..if u do get little dirt spots in the film .. use the sticky tape to clean the spot on the screen and then on the screen protector and reapply.. and u should be golden!
0.9282700999999999	0.766938	The iPhone5 HD/Clear screen protector pleasantly surprised me with its high quality craftsmanship. The fitting is precise* and the cuts around the edges of the screen are clean; and once applied properly, inconspicuous. Tech Armor's Customer Service team is attentive, professional and timely. *I received one slightly off fitting screen, contacted TA's Customer Service by email and I received a response and a replacement immediately.
0.99756336	0.8376968000000001	This has to be the best privacy screen for the iPhone 5. It's smooth, thin, easy to apply, and does the job of not letting anyone see what you are doing! I highly recommend this product if your looking through screen protectors.
0.99711895	0.8109678000000001	I bought this four way privacy screen protector almost a month ago & it works like a charm . I'm capable of going about my business without anyone else looking at what I am doing . this item was definitely worry its price
0.99888664	0.8495896999999999	This is by far, the best screen protector I have ever used so far. The crisp, beautiful colors of the hd screen in my phone do not get suppressed like with every other screen protector! It is very smooth at touch, and honestly, I would totally recommend this brand to every single phone owner out there.
0.9878812	0.7431293999999999	No fingerprints, easy to install, wish I had bought them sooner. Ordering more for my kid's cell phones as well.
0.97983426	0.6219376999999999	The guy at the AT&T store put this on for me when I bought my phone (how nice of him since I didn't buy it there, but on Amazon!) I really, really love how clear it is! And I watched the guy and he had no problems putting it on (which is good, because I had to take my new phone in since it wasn't working, and now I have to put another one on my new phone!) I'm glad it comes with 3 because if I botch one, I'll have another :) Excellent product!
0.9968200999999999	0.7456989	This product is great! Easy to apply and it looks fantastic. Just what y needed! I don't see any cons and it is really good!
0.97237235	0.7941600000000001	These protectors are really easy to apply and work very well with the case I purchased.  I can't even tell that there is a screen protector on the phone.
0.96230686	0.7190144	The screen protectors didnt have any scratch on it like other said. They are in good condition when I received. And it is easy to apply, no bubble formed on the screen. Worth the money
0.48408988	0.6201286	I have nothing to compare this too since it was the first screen protector i every used. Some slight bubbles after application, but it certainly protects the screen and doesn't obstruct clarity. doesn't peel off around the edges and is uniform.
0.9988471999999999	0.79904556	This is by far one of the best screen protectors I have ever bought!  Comes in a pack of 3.  It also comes with a lint free cloth which helps.  It glides on smoothly and bubble free.  I especially love that it maintains the iPhone 5's crisp clarity. This is a must buy.
0.70140624	0.70072466	When I bought my iPhone 5. I bought a screen protecter that was pricy from AT&T.; I drove me crazy. It would not stay in place. It was very difficult writing. I was constantly trying to make it lie flat.The Tech Armor Anti-Glare 7 Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector is wonderful. It doesn't move, it stays in place. I can easily read on it out of doors. I use Kindle on my iPhone and am a voracious reader. It is so clear. It is the best. This is my 4th iPhone and I've always had problems with the screen protectors until now.In fact I like it so much I ordered one for my iPad Mini. I also looked for one for my Magellon GPS but no luck there.Tech Armor is quality. I am so happy with it.
0.7812100000000001	0.7249552	Love this because its matte finish instead of shiny and cuts the glare when using my phone outside on a sunny day.
0.9939610999999999	0.6957248	Super fast shipping, got a great price . I would buy again. This product works very well with my I phone 5Keep up the good work
0.99625415	0.84596306	This product works well. My phone is very protected from the elements and it was very easy to install. Left no bubbles and is clear
0.055969954	0.57810044	The first try I missed a free bubbles then the second one got a bend and the third one almost worked but got too many dust particles underneath and now the bottom corner isn't staying put :(
0.96946114	0.6542071	This is the only screen protector I have purchased for my iPhone 5, so I don't really have any others to compare it to. I feel that they definitely help with the glare and seem to be working very well. I would purchase again.
0.9949220999999999	0.7446381999999999	I am always really careful about ordering products online! I'm not sure if they will work or not! I chose this one because of the lifetime warranty, and I'm really glad I did! I did 2 day shopping, the product arrived on time and was excellent! Easy to put on, no air bubbles and sticks to my phone great! The protector is really clear too! I love it. Will buy again for sure!
0.75810206	0.6877919	It is actually slightly tricky to place (the cutouts tolerances are tight which makes a little difficult to fit over the camera AND over the menu button). You get the hang of it after a couple of trials. For this I would have given to it just 4 stars but it DID save my screen twice for which I am grateful hence the 5 stars! (once when a piece of sharp metal from a welded sculpture brushed against the screen, and once when the screen come in contact with a metal beer cap!)
0.88448614	0.8092895	I watched the video and followed directions but still kept getting air bubbles on the screen. I called their tech support and they called back quickly. They advised having scotch tape on hand to pull the invisible dust particles off the screen. It worked perfectly and they were very helpful. Also the screen fits perfectly! I burned through 2 screens before calling tech support. They sent me a new batch of 3 for free. I am very happy with the product and the vendor.
0.9700875	0.7399543000000001	The instructions are very clear and I didn't have a problem with installation at all. It's a good value at the Prime price as well. A pack of three is very convenient.
0.9974619	0.80115163	Good product, easy to use. No bubbles on the screen and fits the phone so well, so my iphone looks so great.Love it!!
0.99851644	0.86066777	Easy to apply and fits perfectly (I can't sag the same for all). Very sturdy to protect so I would suggest to anyone.
0.93448997	0.8560915000000001	After trying different screen protectors, I finally found the right one. The protectors came quick and did exactly what I was expecting it to be doing. I got it on in one try for both my sister and my phone. the screen protecter is really high quality and is thin and invisible. You can't even tell that you have it on, and def can't feel it either. The home button is cut out perfectly and the width of the protector is only about .02 mm shy on both side. the cam cut out is not actually just a hole, but a long stretched out ellipse style cut out (same shape as the cut out of the listening port when you talk on the phone) I will definitely buy from this company again!
0.99190176	0.83622694	Received my order quickly.  Easy to install.  Was impressed by emails from Tech Armor demonstrating tips and the correct way to install the screen protectors.
0.27764058	0.50895053	Thought this would be better, given that it has excellent reviews, but it is not. The reviews are just deceiving.This screen protector is thin and NOT DURABLE. Mine now have 2 holes in the middle. I know it was caused by my keys inside my pocket, but with the previous Spigen Sgp screen protector i had, it was never a problem.
0.53019214	0.57660824	These are a must have to protect your phone.  They don't go on as easily as the regular because thee are thicker but would purchase again.
0.96278816	0.83705354	"Tried this on my 4th iPhone under the Otterbox Defender. I had the Defender on my 5, but was getting some glare and ""oiliness"" under certain lights. After attaching this screen protector the glare and oiliness are gone. Also, the protector was really easy to apply compared to others I've used over the years. I would definitely recommend this to others."
0.58248204	0.78597873	Putting the product on was fairly easy and it does a good job of protecting. However, it doesn't seem to last very long as it is already peeling at the edges and scratches easily as well. Not many complaints though as it does keep scratches off of the phone itself and does make the screen look crystal clear. No problems with the touch screen either.
0.98023736	0.86613744	The dust tape is spectacular and worked really well. I got the screen protector on easily and there were no bubbles. The instructions gave good tips that I used. This is the first time I've had a screen protector with no bubbles, and it does not impair the retina display at all. I had a little bit of trouble getting it to match the front of screen perfectly, as it kept covering the camera hole, but after a few tries, it went on easily. I'm impressed. The screen wipe does leave a bit of lint on the surface, so be sure to use more of the tape to get rid of dust. I would definitely buy from them again. The cleaning wipe is good for cleaning other screens as well, so keep it!
0.9859235000000001	0.7669716999999999	Great screen protector!  Usually it is a pain to apply the screen protectors, because they don't give exact instructions on what the best way to apply it is.  This company had detailed instructions that made the application fairly difficult, but very rewarding.  There was 2 almost undetectable bubbles on the very bottom of the screen, which is LEAGUES better than any other screen protector I have applied. Thanks so much for a great product!
0.85828674	0.7726828	Although these things are always hard to install, this film is more forgiving than some. The videos on their website are OK but not helpful if you have installed one before. I was able to get the first protector to fit without any bubbles after a few tries.Once the shield is on, it looks great. The screen color is great and there are no problems with the touch screen. I would certainly recommend these! There are three protectors in the package and the price is good.
0.966938	0.7886219	This went on so well, no bubbles at all. The no-glare, no-fingerprint matte finish is terrific. This is all I will buy from now on.
0.9894722	0.8076720000000001	Protector fit perfectly and applied easily with very few bubbles.  The bubbles disappeared in a day.  Directions were very clear on how to apply the protector.
0.81071603	0.7432138	The quality is good.  Still clear after ~2weeks use. Fits well with slim case. A bit difficult to install --- need to be careful to avoid bubble.
0.9931988000000002	0.83467233	When this first arrived, there was so much pollen in the air that I was concerned that it would be hard to get it on my phone without a lot of dust particles. So I waited until after I had taken a shower, let the steam die down and applied the screen protector in the bathroom. I watched the video instructions, and had no problem at all. Easy-peesy! It went on with one try!. There were three little specks of dust, which I lifted off with the tape provided, and the few air bubbles smoothed right out with my credit card. I love the anti-glare, and the anti-fingerprint is great! This is well worth the money. So glad I bought it.
0.97307944	0.809384	3 came in a package. Make absolutely sure there are no dust particles in your area.Installed on my iPhone 5 with ease. I like the Anti-Glare - Anti Fingerprints works greatUsed a second one on sons iPod 5th Gen, we had to trim the top off so it wouldn't peel while in caseIt worked well.  Screen is totally protected
0.9882951999999999	0.63828605	Easy to apply it to my iPhone by just following step-by-step instruction.Reasonable price by comparing to ones that are sold in Best Buy
0.94126666	0.77698445	For the price, this is pretty nice. You get 3. I bought a $25 lifetime screen protector from AT&T, and these look just as nice. With the right case, they shouldn't need to be replaced very often.
0.97035	0.80859137	Easy to apply to the iPhone. The price was way better than paying $20 in the store. And you can't even tell that there is a screen protector because it makes your screen so clear- almost invisible.
0.9659446	0.74526286	I like that this does no leave fingerprints or is glare proof like my other screen shields in the past.  My phoneAlways looks clean.
0.52744997	0.51098675	I really wanted to love this product, based on all the positive reviews but as soon as I put my first one on I knew it wasn't going to be bubble free so i tried the 2nd time and I still had trouble.. It's probably me but usually I get a screen protector on just fine on my first try.. With these that wasn't the case.. I wish it was though.
0.8744607	0.76251864	I really like this case.. It fits perfectly and I love the color, however I've only had it a month and the rubber border is already coming off!!
0.98814076	0.8476851999999999	Product is exactly as it is described. Read the instructions on how to apply but if somehow a tiny spec of lint gets on the cover, it comes with a dust removal tape which is very handy in removing from the cover. Protects the screen & Tech Armor has a lifetime warranty. Definitely would recommend this product in protecting the Iphone5 screen.
0.41181687	0.39235294	I saved the original screen cover until I received this. The application was not difficult, just follow the instructions. I'm not sure what some other customers did wrong but I got no bubbles at all. I am a happy customer! :)
0.045251400000000004	0.48251152	Not the worst screen protectors I have ever bought, but certainly not the best either. The protector itself is a very nice material - smooth and glossy looking and hardly seems there. That is until you see the bottom of the right side where it just refused to stick at all. I have about a one centimeter line that no matter what I do will not adhere down. Other then that one issue I really liked these, but unfortunately it is a rather large issue.
0.8831728000000001	0.7357598000000001	I have to admit I've only had the screen protector for about 3 hours but I'm so thrilled with it. I never write reviews but I had to. Typically I HATE screen protectors. They are a pain to apply and the bubbles drive me bonkers. This went on like a glove. I actually didn't even have to use the squeegee provided. I also love the matte finish!  For whatever reason it seems like my iPhone 5 is responding better with the protector on. Anyways - BUY THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR NOW!  :)
0.64516747	0.6005391999999999	I have worked at apple for a few years and had every iPhone to date and installed 200 to many screen protectors and this was probably the most challenging one to date. Once it has a piece of dust or anything attached it was almost impossible to take it off without adding more. It took me all 3 to get one that looked good, I'm satisfied with the protector - I'm just bummed i had to throw 2 away before i could get one right.
0.99474806	0.737083	It is a great screen protector. I love the way it look on my iphone 5.NO PROBLEMS AT ALL!!!! LOVE IT
0.98187345	0.7962357	From experience with other screen protectors these solve and improved the issues like glare and clear very easy to install and no bubbles no interference with touch screen it delivers the goods!
0.9257728000000001	0.7384411999999999	Perfect little screen protector. Nice and clear (hd version) can hardly tell its even on. The cutout a for the speaker and camera aren't too big either. Also came with a peice of adhesive to remove dust particles that get stuck under the protector during application which came in handy. I will come back to this brand for screen protectors in the future. Until screens don't exist anymore, that is.
0.00470978	0.27002853	I followed the directions and none of the three protector would stick to the screen at all. The item is useless.
0.13717756	0.6275432	I've had the screen protector for a couple months and it isn't peeling or anything of the sort. It's worth the couple of bucks.
0.71155363	0.53917587	Despite wasting two protectors installing it as bubble free as I could get it I was satisfied with the product.  However, I was surprised to find that my screen protector became deeply scratched and I don't even know how.  I am very careful with my phone and occasionally it does get tossed into my purse but the scratches that turned up are deep and I don't know how I got them.  I didn't drop the phone or anything harmful like that. Perhaps it was just a defected item in the pack of three.My husband is using the third sheet on his phone and so far he has had no issues.  It looks great on his phone and I'm so bummed that I don't have another one to replace this scratched one since I had so much trouble installing it the first time and had to use two.Time will tell how it does with my husbands phone. I might buy another package if his seems to be ok because I do like how crystal clear they are.  You don't even notice that the phone has a screen protector on it.
0.49430424	0.56477296	After giving my screen a good cleaning with the included cloth, I peeled the one side off the screen protector and when it was almost fully applied, I speck of dust shot in and stuck to the screen protector. I tried to scrape it off, but gave up. After working most of the air out from around it, I really can't notice it when the screen is on. After a few weeks, I can recommend this product. Just be in as dust free of an environment that you can find.
0.9808460999999999	0.84818983	Overall great screen protector that I believe will work well (protecting against scratches, etc.) The price is on point for what it includes. It is easy to put on and you can barely tell there's anything there unless you really look. I like the fact that it comes with three screen protectors. Even though it took me all three tries to get it perfect, it was really easy to apply. There is no need for those water solutions and other extraneous application products that some screen protectors require. My only gripe with this is that the holes for the camera and earpiece are a little large, but still work.
0.9987806	0.87242436	This shield is perfect for the new iphone 5.  It fits the screen perfectly and it is crystal clear. You do not even realize that the shield is on. It is better than the protectors sold in the apple stores, as those distort the picture slightly. As mentioned, Tech Armor's are perfectly clear.  Highly recommebd the product for all new iphone purchasers.
0.99211186	0.69327366	This product is great. It provides great protection, yet it is completely clear. I can't even tell it is on the phone at all. Important note though, be sure to read the directions and apply correctly.
0.040755599999999996	0.49451190000000006	the screen protecter was not like in the pic nor was it the rite size, it didnt have the holes punch out
0.15056536	0.5124185	When applied on the Iphone it is OK.  However, when we put the phone in the case, the case pushes against the screen protector and the protector comes off.  I wish the protector had a little bit more stickiness to it.
0.01790157	0.37691337	I had a hard time separating the sheets and applying it correctly.  Lots of bubbles on the screen after two applications.  Will not order again.
0.84718287	0.6284958	The screen protector looks amazing on my phone but the lint from the gray wipe has landed on my screen.  Next time I will use a different wipe.  I used all three screens and stuck with the 3rd since I didn't want my screen scratched.  But the 3rd was not as bad as the first two.  All in all more of a user error than Tech Armor's fault.
0.9716603000000001	0.8152736	This is the only screen protector that was easy to put on with no bumps underneath from dust. It is also extremely clear (can't tell there is a screen protector on. I will not use any other brand from now on.  I love it - and so do the kids.
0.34037495	0.59116507	Great anti-glare, doesn't reduce the screen quality too much. Just the bubbles are are to get rid of especially if dust gets under it - good thing they give you 3 in a pack. They hole the earphone was not directly centered.
0.22014102	0.44696897	For this to be a 360 privacy screen, it looks as if I get no privacy at all. I thought maybe I was being bias because of my high expectations but my girlfriend even said she believe they give no privacy since I brought her the same one. The good thing is that it was for a small price. The bad thing is I will have to go out and find a privacy screen that will actually be private.
0.9818084999999999	0.77952933	Great screen protector. My wife doesn't even know it's on there. She just drops her phone in her purse and having screen protector is a necessity. It's pretty tough so far (2 weeks) and is handling the abuse of her purse well.
0.16101772	0.55482817	Overall it's a clear protector and looks like nothing when applied. Only issue is getting alignment correctly. Had 3 and ended up losing two before geting the third one aligned correctly. Only reason for three star rating is the frustrating alignment. Just purchaased another iPhone for my wife and may use another brand.
0.9866964	0.8073543000000001	I bought a privacy screen before this one and it was HORRIBLE, all it did was &#34;dim&#34; my screen, I could still see everything and so could others.. from crazy angles.With this one, NO ONE can see what's going on, best privacy screen I've bought and IF I need another one, it will DEFINITELY be a TECH ARMOR one. Great job guys! Buy this one!!
0.23449051	0.5814878000000001	It's a thin piece of clear plastic, what could possibly go wrong?comes with a nice cloth to clean the screen and the directions are simple and straight forward. These should last you about 2 months per change. Unless you are okay with small blemishes from keys and what not scraping it.
0.98352396	0.81382704	It went very smoothly. It was shipped well, the instructions were very clear, and the product came with a few tools to help you put it on correctly. The kit included a cloth to wipe down the screen but also included a sticky pad that helps remove any dust particles before you put the screen protector down.
0.99571145	0.85922134	I have tried various screen protectors for my iPhone and I have never kept one on longer than a week, the Tech Armor went on with no bubbles or and fit perfectly (use the cleaning cloth on your screen prior to applying).  I love the matte look and feel.
0.9214226999999999	0.62879765	Includes 3 covers for the iphone 5.  They even sent me a video link that demonstrates the installation process.  Will definitely buy more as needed
0.8420576	0.3389598	The film was too hard to apply and not get bubbles under the screen. Thank you thank you thank you
0.98180676	0.8316853999999999	This is a very good screen protector and I had virtually no problems installing it. I would add that following the instructions in the video available on their website was very helpful ... I watched it three or four times before I tried the installation and then followed ALL the instructions and it went perfectly. I had two or three bubbles at the end and these were easily removed with the supplied card. By way of qualificatiions, I am not an experienced installer of these things, am 75, and have only one eye. So go for it .. worth every penny.
0.99004304	0.84351015	These screen protectors are very good quality. Put it on my iPhone 5 before I even took it out of the box. Thankfully the pack included 3 since i messed up first 2 try's, but 3 times the charm proves true, and I got it to align perfectly. No bubbles, and I can't even tell there's a screen protector on my phone, that's how clear it is! Very pleased with my purchase overall, especially at such a low price!!
0.99893403	0.7539364000000001	Very very Very satisfied. Highly recommended! .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..  Iphone5 hd
0.013955623	0.46502507	Would not recommend product. I don't like it because it started bubbling up in a very short time. Change it with another same results and it is not Anti-Glare
0.99916106	0.85215175	I am the kind of person who is constantly changing phone accessories. I have tried numerous screen protectors, ranging from the cheapest to Invisible Shields.  This screen protector is by far my favorite. When they say HD they mean it- my screen looks BETTER than without a screen protector. I also love how for a little less than 6 dollars I get 3 screen protectors. Very happy with my purchase- highly recommended.
0.5162319000000001	0.6207461999999999	A co-worker commented that I should have a screen protector even though it was already there! Does not distort your view and no bubbles or anything as long as you're careful in installing it. As easy as 1-2-3!
0.75860834	0.6466553	It is a Very nice screen protector with easy installation.When properly installed, it looks as if nothing is on the screen.
0.6776446999999999	0.66109425	"I was in love with this protector(matte), I loved the way it felt under my finger, how I could not worry about sunshine...then about two months later I could see the wear spots where I always was swiping and I don't care what anyone says, you can see the rainbow in the screen.  But its not a deal breaker.My biggest concern is how my screen got cracked.  Im not expecting this thing to be a substitute for a lifeproof case, or any case with a built in screen protector, I just wanted some protection from an occasional accident and obviously scratches.It was halloween and we were out trick or treating with the kids and my phone fell out of my pocket as I bent over.  It fell 12"" on gravel, face down on a pebble.  It happen so quick, no spider cracks, just one long crack and the little spot that caused it."
0.514342	0.6577294	Cons: Not 100% bubble free (corner does not stick very well) and the holes for the camera and speaker do not line up exactly. Hard to see the screen in the sun light due to the matte finished.Pros: No more fingerprints on the screen and anti-glare as it described. Hopefully, they will replace the screens due to wear and tear as they claimed for lifetime warranty.
0.6142251	0.6780468000000001	These is a good buy for the price. It serves it purpose very well. Although I did have to alter the protector by cutting off the edges because of my iphone case.
0.9809097	0.76969373	Great product and delivery was extremely fast(east coast) Yes it is thick yes your retina display is a little off but that is the choice you make when you buy this product. I can see perfectly fine but is a stunning HD super screen? No! but I knew that coming in there has to be an equivalent exchange this product does exactly what is asked!
0.8581456000000001	0.8204311	I purchased a different brand first and had an awful experience. (Click my other reviews to see, I find it disrespectful to talk about other companies when reviewing a product.)This product was great.  I applied it with ease to my new iPhone 5 on the First try and didn't even have to lift it to remove any pieces of dust.  The alignment was excellent.  The directions were accurate and simple.  I have been using this protector for several weeks, and I find it responsive and smooth.It does show ALOT of finger prints. So what, you can clean them off.  If that bothers you however, I understand, and perhaps look elsewhere.  Otherwise I highly recommend this screen protector.  And now I have two extra to use down the road!
0.46006495	0.52101994	This is fantastic!!  Its thicker than normal screen protectors and I have not had one single fingerprint on the screen since I put it on.  Not even after putting lotion on my hands!!  I'll never buy another type of screen protector again.
0.9903648000000002	0.83862674	All these years, I have fought with bubbles.  I read a review about getting the matte one and that's what I chose.  Not one air bubble.  I do have one itty bitty nick (maybe it is air) but it is so small and you can't see it -but I can.Truly terrific. I did not remove the entire backing since old habits die hard.  I started from the bottom and placed it, removing the backing as I went along.  I can tell that I should have positioned it slightly better (higher) but again no one will notice this but me and when I change my case again, I will know how to position it better.I had no issues putting it on. I cleaned the screen with a dab of alcohol and a microfiber cleaning cloth. Some people said they went into the restroom to put it on - I put it on in the kitchen under the vent of my microwave.  I put the fan on to make sure it pulled up any lint floating around.I simply peeled part of it back and started at the bottom and I got it on without ANY bubbles.I have a 5C phone and the screen protector did not go exactly edge to edge.  I have a case on my phone and it is 100% protected.Note: I wear both contacts and glasses but mainly glasses and, to me, the matte screen is perfect.  There are no fingerprint smudges and I can see the display perfectly and I have my light set to under 50%. The screen felt weird at first, now it's normal and there is no change in sensitivity.I am going to order the clear and/or glass one to compare when I change out my case.I'm a heavy phone user and this is a great screen protector that truly goes on bubble free.
0.89942676	0.682829	Prior to ordering...I really read through tons and tons of reviews...for many reasons especially how to &#34;apply&#34; as it seems that many reviewers had a lot to stress difficulty (or not) of application.  So being that I am a first time Apple phone user/first time screen protector applier/user/etc., I did not have any difficulty applying the screen protector myself.Thus far, I am content with this product!!
0.0043628216	0.2854457	Case for I phone 5 was badly made.  Did not need screen covers then so they were returned.  Did not open package.
0.16830635	0.4413638	I purchased this product due to the other reivews it recieved on Amazon. I opened the packaging and the directions were simple enough so I proceeded to place the screen protector on. As I got to the cut out for the camera and speaker on top of the phone I noticed it wasnt centered. The bottom main button was fine but the top did not line up. I figured it must of been a defect for just that one protector. So I tried the other two and they both had the same issue!!? Now I still have it on because it doesnt cover up the camera or speaker it just isnt centered at all which really bothers me but it will have to do for now. I ordered another brand to see if the fit will be any better.
0.2848389	0.40630034	I of course thought I was above reading the directions and tried haphazardly to apply the screen protector on my own not realizing until I was on my 2nd protector that something here was wrong.  In fact there are 3 layers not just 2!!!  once I watched the video and realized that there is no tab on the actual screen protector it went on flawlessly and beautifully.  heed the directions, save your sanity.
0.9977623	0.7778096999999999	Got 3 of these and they're great! very high quality and feels great!won't hesitate to purchase more in the future if needed.
0.76765835	0.60711807	Cool, I like this. But it's just two layers, not three layers. But it is still cool. It makes screen become darker.
0.97708386	0.554467	Love it!  Easy to install. I wish this product was less expensive but that is my only complaint.  Great product!
0.9882243	0.7163329	I order this product for my new iPhone 5.  When I got the 3 pack I ended up using all three protectors and after calling customer service I found I was putting them on wrong.  The representation was very nice, sent me additional installation information and a new order of protectors.  Great product with great customer service.  Love Them....
0.9990107	0.79337955	great product!!! highly recommend. Can't tell you have it on.  Clarity is very clear. Can't beat the lifetime guarantee and price.
0.9657372	0.7911085999999999	I was a little worried, after reading the reviews, about whether or not I would be able to apply the screen protector and not have air bubbles or major difficulty with application.  I am not the most careful or detailed person, yet, I put the screen protector on (bugles in the background please!) with no difficulty in a kitchen with dim lighting and had no, i repeat  NO air bubbles under the protector.  I cleaned the screen of my iPhone with the cloth provided and peeled the plastic from the screen protector.  The only hitch was wondering which was the sticky side of the protector and which was not.  Once I figured that out, the rest was easy!  I also wondered if it would make using the iPhone feel different.  This is my first iPhone and I feel a little over protective of how the screen feels as I use it and was weighing the feel of the screen with the value of protecting it.  However, with this product, I didn't have to choose.  The first few minutes I wondered if I made a mistake because there was a slight amount of increased drag.  About an hour later, once my hyper-vigilance wore off, I realized the difference was slight, if at all.  I am very pleased with my purchase and am about to test my husband's ability to detect the screen protectors presence.  He doesn't know it is there and I bet he won't be able to tell.  I'm very glad I bought this screen protector!
0.94649124	0.757262	Very easy to install. I followed instructions and no bubbles, no dust on the screen. Touch screen is just as sensitive as without the screen but have screen protected from scratches. Have purchased three sets for three different phones. Would not hesitate to buy again.
0.8898226	0.7590923	I've used many different kinds and brands of screen protectors only to be disappointed on the quality that usually ends up subpar at best. The Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protectors are a cut above the rest!
0.8541199	0.6961713	The pack as advertised comes in 3; the first turned out to be a botched up job; got it right with no bubbles the second time round after watching a YouTube video! Good screen protector.
0.9981431999999999	0.90964663	I've used screen protectors for over a decade.  I went through a dozen phones over the last 2 years as I run mobile for my company.  I started using Tech Amor last year and have been blow away by their products. I recently picked up the 5S and chose this product for my phone.  I've watched this product develop and they have continued to improve the packaging and materials and I can say it is the best.I used to use 3M, but their stuff is just too much of pain to apply and really messes with the viewing.  This product is easy to apply (and I suck at applying these things). They include a cleaning cloth, lint tape, bubble board for removing the bubbles, and really good instructions.  The product has easy to remove backing for the sticky side of the cover and a tab to help you remove it.  As usual, I didn't center it properly, and I was able to lift the cover off with the lint tape without damaging the sticky side and replace it.  It is perfect (and I'm anal).For the price you get something of great value.  People who see their product always compliment the clarity of the screen as well as the privacy.  The best part for me is the texture.  I love the way it feels under my fingers, and it helps me with swiping and being more accurate with my taps when I'm playing games or typing.  When I give my phones to other people, they always leave it on and love it.
0.9988629000000001	0.8481003	This was easy to apply, fits well, and looks great. Fits much better than the package I purchased from my carrier originally, and cost 1/5 the price.
0.042636573	0.37839973	I think the product leaves too many bubbles on its edges. And it is extremely hard to get the product on right... When i removed it and put it back on, it did not look very good... I have used much better
0.5260585999999999	0.5031925	Installed this screen protector a little while ago and it is honestly like nothing is on the screen. I have the Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 5 and the screen protector that it comes with is awful so I removed it and replaced it with this one and I couldn't be happier with a screen protector. No rainbow watermark, no bubbles, no discoloration, no distortion, no problems at all.
0.9877003000000001	0.76749516	I preordered the latest iPhone and definitely needed an anti-glare/matte finish screen protector.  In short, this suits all my needs and adheres without much hassle and onto the latest iPhones perfectly.
0.79457533	0.61461765	it was hard to install at first due to trying to avoid any bubbles. Customer service was really helpful where they send another screen protector for my troubles. Overall great product to have to protect your iphone
0.11167762	0.5494422	I've ordered screen protectors from both ACase and Tech Armor. The ACase are basically the exact thing, but a bit cheaper. Two out of the three were also incorrectly cut.Pros:- Nice packaging compared to some of the other cheap screen protectors.- First one seemed to be cut incorrectly...couldn't get the home button + camera/speaker to all line up properly. Second protector did not have this issue (hopefully #3 is cut OK)- Installation was easy, provided you have a dust/hair free environment to apply it in- Once it's on, you can't notice it. Works as advertised.Cons:-One of the protectors seemed to be cut incorrectly.Wrap-up:They work well, especially for the price. At the end of the day, they're just screen protectors and there's not much more you can say.
0.99771833	0.82997215	These screen protectors are perfect. They go on very easily, and they feel and look great. I will keep on buying these while i have an iphone.
0.9979249	0.8223134	Fits perfectly.  You have to be patient, but if you get it right, you will NEVER know it's on there.  I have dropped my phone a few times on gravel, and it protected it totally.  Highly recommended!
0.74171597	0.62993824	This is a decent screen protector, but the price is a little high for what you get. I had some trouble getting the screen protector to fit properly the first time, but that's probably because I rarely ever put a screen protector on.Overall, I wasn't that pleased with the feel of the screen protector and ended up going back to bare glass. While it may be for some people, I like the feel of the iPhone screen a lot better than the screen protector.
0.9797893	0.76774734	Went on very easily with no issues.  If you follow instructions and make sure there is no dust, all bubbles will disappear.  I recommend installing it underneath the stovetop fan to help eliminate dust.
0.9938882	0.722106	Great for the iphone and gives great privacy coverage while still being able to see when you need to work things...love it!
0.027771413	0.58511674	The screen protectors were difficult to apply. The directions were unclear. Once I got them on, they were not secure at the edges. I wrote them asking for replacements 2 months ago but they have not acknowledged my letter.
0.99275225	0.7965107	The product in itself is everything I had been looking for. It gives a smooth, clean, sleek look to your screen and it doesn't leave any fingerprinted marks. Additionally, it's matte finish makes it so much easier to view your screen in highly lit areas.I'd also like to compliment Tech Armor for being a lead retailer in Customer Service. I encountered a small issue with the delivery of my item and they quickly resolved it.I would purchase this product and or any other from this retailer blindly again!
0.8704697	0.7901071	When I bought my Iphone 5, I purchased a screen cover at best buy with it. The edges peeled up, and dirt got underneath within a month. I purchased these, and am so much happer. The cover does not show makeup as bad as the other one, and it is much more responsive. The edges have stayed put, and the phone looks way better with the new screen protector. So glad I got the 3-pack, because these are great!
0.9994699	0.7531053000000001	Perfect job. Works excellent. Just as I expected. Good price. Love that it comes with a cloth. Does what it is supposed to do. Would recommend this to anyone. Easy to put on - and virtually invisible. Wish I could rate all products I've purchased this highly.
0.9971761999999998	0.8350523999999999	I have no complaints! They went on easily. Love the tape, the cardboard, and the cleaning cloth. Will definitely purchase again.
0.9955492	0.83551526	This screen protector was so easy to put on my iphone5 as well as my husbands.  I got it on mine no problems at all the first time on my phone...hubbies the 2nd time as his phone was (even after cleaning it) still dusty.  So that was my fault.  THANK GOODNESS they send you three!  I love how it fits the phone and how it feels.  I also have a Otterbox cover for my phone and just wanted some added protection for my screen as I had read some say that their screens still get scratched. My hubby keeps his phone in his pocket most times and it still gets dusty inside the Otterbox cover. Another reason why I wanted added screen protection. It works fine with the added protection.  No problems at all.  I intend to order the same ones for my youngest son and another son's wife both of whom have the iphone4.
0.9796165000000001	0.7873975999999999	I bought this for my husband's phone since I liked the one I bought for my iPhone4S. I chose this item because it had two extra protectors, just in case I messed up the first application. Turns out I had nothing to worry about it was easy to apply with the cardboard and lint-free cloth. I like how sturdy the plastic is on the protector. It protects my screen from my clumsy self... I drop my phone at least once a week. The protector doesn't impact the touch screen capability at all.
0.99797535	0.79438674	These fit my iPhone 5 S perfectly.  The price is great and I couldn't be more pleased!  I recommend this product!
0.91424763	0.73312664	Comes with 3 different protectors, squeegee, dust remover tape, and cleaning cloth.I'm a perfectionist and when 1 spec of dust got in the first time, I redid it. Now it looks perfect. THANK YOU for providing more than 1.As for the feel, it has a bit more of a grip then I like. I like it to feel more like glass, but I got over this quickly. Especially since it's impossible to even tell that there's a protector on the phone now.
0.9888184000000001	0.8057749	Just got this screen protector. It was exactly what I was looking for. It was quick and easy to put on the phone and I did not have any real issues with air bubbles. I would definitely recommend getting this screen protector if you are looking for a good anti-glare screen protector for your iPhone.
0.5218197	0.44578950000000006	Although I like the white case, the other 3 were not as well constructed but they are good to have.  Now the screen protector must have been bent or something in shipping because it's creased and I can't use.  That kinda ticks me off.  What can I do though?  If that had come in good condition I would have given this a 4.
0.99808764	0.8207888000000001	This product works well and is easy to apply. I had no bubbles the first time around, so I can save the other two (product came in 3-pack) in case I damage this one. The product is high quality and maintains the clear resolution I love in the iPhone screens. Tech Armor is a professional seller and seems very willing to satisfy its customers. Although I had no problems with this purchase, I feel that I would be able to easily reach them and ask for help. I recommend the product and the seller.
0.37740976	0.51446885	Took two tries, but easy to install. Of course being who I am i failed to read the instruction on how to properly install this item, it didn't come out the way i had hoped attempt number two without fail works great.
0.8779370999999999	0.5534049	So happy to finally have iphone screen protection. I scratched the h*ll out of my last iphone screen.  Every phone owner should own this.
0.11465764	0.41509157	I chose this on price, but basically it's junk. The protector, once on, is not clear, but a foggy cast over the screen. It's a bear to get on. Even if you do get it on right, it dims your iphone screen to the point it's not worth having on.I would not buy this--there are plenty of &#34;clear&#34; screen protectors out there.
0.99079156	0.7601009	Easy to apply even if you goof up the first time.  No need to wet the screen, etc., like other products require.  I appreciate the good matte finish and really helps with the glare without too much distortion or loss of screen quality.
0.98696023	0.7728791	I bought this screen protector for my iphone 5 and i am very picky about screen protectors i figured that i will just give these a shot. I messed up installing the first one and the scecond one i installed perfectly and could not be more satisfied with thos purchase!!! Would recommend to anyone without even thinking a bout it
0.9801306999999999	0.7961597	Good screen protector. Strong adhesive. I had a little trouble applying the sticker since it doesn't seem to fit 100% perfectly.
0.9903294	0.80149424	So simple to put on, normally I get a few bubbles but I was able to put this on without any. Looks fabulous.
0.989208	0.8521290000000001	I've been putting screen protectors on my devices for a long time.  With several iphones in the past, ipads, etc.  I will say these went down the easiest with no bubbles or scratches.  They are crystal clear and allow the brightness and vibrance of the screen shine through.  Tech Armor is the brand I'll look for from now on.
0.7782833	0.710572	There is some reason to there being three screen protectors in this package: You'll likely need a few attempts to get a perfect, dust-free fit. On the first two attempts ai got little pieces of dust or crums underneath the protector, leaving ugly bubbles. When you start pulling off the sheet covering the adhesive side of the protector, it creates quite some significant static electric charge. Even though I had perfectly cleaned the phone before application, the static electric charge must have picked up some dust or dirt pieces from around the phone.Long story short. Make sure you work in an as much as possible dust-free environment.Now I have a perfect, dust- and bubble-free fit.Edit: I upgraded my review to 5 stars. Tech Armor contacted me and offered a free replacement kit for my trouble. Dedication to customers deserves an extra star.
0.58363557	0.6712768	I just received this product, it fits alright (might be just me, I couldn't align it perfectly). On the last screen cover I managed to get it on, still a few bubbles. Could be better, but overall decent.
0.99239695	0.84661436	I wanted a screen protector for my new iPhone, but didn't want to pay $30 for a thin piece of plastic.  Plus, who can get the screen protectors on in one shot?  It's always nice to have a few extras.  The Tech Armor screen protector was a great choice.  It came in a pack of 3 and was only $6!  Everything arrived lightning fast.  The package comes with the 3 protectors as well as a small bubble eliminator, polishing cloth, and detailed instructions.  It couldn't have been easier. I was able to get everything on the phone on the first try, and it took under 5 minutes.  I am using this with the Tech Armor frosted cover, and when putting the cover on, the protector didn't bubble up or lift off. A major plus!I'm so happy I went with Tech Armor!
0.013012767	0.4959223	Following drections exactly, i went through all three covers, because the final 'remove me' sticker would not come off smoothly, leaving in one, a tear it was so tighly adhered, and with the other two, there was a very visable rectangle where it had been, with remnants of paper still on it, as all faulty/old stickers will do. Total waste of my time and money.
0.9995811	0.84373707	This screen protector is easy to install, it protects well, and it looks great.  I would highly recommend this product.
0.020771235	0.48819589999999996	Very clear but this product does not completely fit the iphone 5s. It is not wide enough and leaves a gap between my case and the screen protector
0.15464967	0.48894107	I've installed as soon as I got the product and a month later i still don't see any scratched or tearing. The cutout was also near perfect.
0.98283327	0.8186929000000001	Have to say,Tech Armor do a great job on making clear instruction and videos to help you put the film on.I put it on successfully and beautifully on my second try.( It came in with three films, which is wonderful as well!)It's been protecting my phone screen since.Only little complain I would have is the fit on the edge.guess, it all depends on what kind of shell/skin you put on your phone.With Tech 21 Impact mesh, it leaves a gap( 1mm-ish) around.
0.9980914000000001	0.79028344	Easy to install.  Works well.  Like the anti glare matte finish.  Fast shipping.  Resists fingerprints. Great instructions given and everything needed inside
0.9958528	0.80689716	Less glare, cleaner feel, better touch. Awesome product. I wouldn't hesitate to reorder this if my current screen protector were to be damaged
0.6085318000000001	0.752374	It was absolutely easy to put on and i love that it is matte textured because the screen doesn't get dirty. I had problem with my fingerprints all over my screen, or sometimes face lotion and it looked horrible. This was easy to apply and does every thing it says it does such ass anti glare and anti fingerprint :)
0.9922466000000001	0.7491483	I have tried several other products and this one has Good clarity and is easy to install. Great one to have .
0.24279365	0.48040113	I have never seen a screen protector that seemed to accumulate dirt and oil like this one does.  It is as if it is a magnet.
0.96630514	0.72307885	Works great, keeps my screen private! Dims my screen but i'd rather have a dim screen than other people being in my business.
0.9980671	0.84195065	I have purchased many screen protectors after getting my iPhone and never came across a particular one I would say I loved that was purchased at a reasonable price. When I got these protectors, I automatically liked how matte they were so my finger marks didn't show up. I had trouble putting on the first two and was not happy with the third application. I then emailed Tech Armor customer service and they were very helpful. They sent me replacements free of charge and offered me some tips for a flawless application. The replacements came quickly which was impressive. Overall, I love the product. The service was WONDERFUL and the shipping was quick!
0.9998504	0.91579485	I was skeptical when ordering these screen protectors quite honestly due to the low price.  I had previously used a very expensive protector that starting peeling off within a few days.  I purchased two packs of the Tech Armor HD protectors and got it perfect on the 2nd try.  It came out flawless and no one can tell I have one on my phone, it's clear and works beautifully.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product!
0.99647844	0.80999124	I only buy matte finish. Don't like the shiny ones. Matte finish is much easier on my eyes. And I always buy this brand. Great value for the money spent!
0.99708426	0.64434826	Good product. Easy to apply and came with good instructions to follow. Would definitely purchase again. And worth the extra few dollars.
0.987743	0.8217238000000001	I've tried Spigen, MediaDevil and other generic screen protectors that come with cases. Based on first impressions this is my favorite. The reason I only gave it four stars is because the camera and speaker portion of the screen protector are not cut more precisely like MediaDevil and Spigen. The reason this screen protector is my favorite is because how thin and clear it is. If it wasn't for the over sized cut outs you wouldn't be able to tell your phone even had a screen protector.  It feels nice to the touch. Install was a breeze, but I've mastered the hinge method pretty well. The trick is to hindge it into place, removed old screen protector next, clean screen well until you see no dust, check aligment once again, check for dust then finally removed Tab 1 and use your clean fingers to seal all the way through. youtube the method, it works for me 100% of the time. Love it, happy with my purchase.
0.9987743	0.7967379	Bought this case for my dad who always drops and breaks his phones! He loves this case! He let me know he dropped his iPhone 5 a bunch of times and the phone is unharmed! I highly recommend this case! It's protects your phone!
0.94769865	0.7144432	At first I didn't realize that there is a special tape included to take away any lint that can attach to the screen protector (but that was b/c I did not read all the directions first). The product is great went on without any bubbles and it came with like 4 screen protectors in one packet. Great product
0.8839565999999999	0.75902784	It took me two tries to get it right (3 screens are included in the package) but I took the advice of several other posters and put the screen on in my bathroom (for the humidity/to reduce dust), and it seemed to work well. I made sure to clean the surface of my iphone thoroughly with the cloth provided, and all bubbles came out nicely. I'm happy as a clam.
0.8369496999999999	0.62913585	I have the white iPhone 5, and you really can't tell that it's there. This is my third iPhone, and my first time using a screen protector on one. You can feel the difference between plastic and glass no matter what, but with this screen protector you definitely can't see the difference.
0.9910158000000001	0.6859259	Thanks again for a well developed product, no glare and it works perfect on my iPhone, again thank you so much!
0.033889055	0.4113872	Greetings,The lines in this screen protector makes for an off putting view. This product just didn't do it for me.[...]
0.99250984	0.82917047	A fraction of the cost of a similar product at Walmart. Quality was great&#8212;it's really lasting on my phone, and my glare has been cut to almost zero. Definitely recommend.
0.6524488	0.6610848000000001	"We all know how tricky this project can be, and even though I've successfully done it before (with a different brand's product, admittedly), I was absolutely determined not to mess up my first screen protector on my brand spanking new iPhone 5. I watched the instructional video on techarmor's website, I followed every single instruction, including clearing a clean space on my bathroom countertop and waiting until the room was foggy, as per their instructions, before applying. The first one went on well enough, I pushed out the minor bubbles, but I was so focused on not bringing the second Remove Me tab up without the outer layer because video had such a big warning about it....that I apparently pulled the entire protective layer right back off! Without realizing it! For two days! (#mastersdegreeatwork) When I finally realized there was no outline around my home button etc, I could not believe it.Second attempt had my focus split between not removing both layers and combatting dust with the scotch tape method (as suggested). That tip worked great.... but unfortunately this resulted in me peeling back one of the corners to get back underneath at a particle (the dust was at the very top--so the last part visible), which permanently bent one of the corners into one of those outer-edge bubbles (I've never peeled back a protector with this result before, to be honest. Maybe it was the way I did it, maybe it was the product, maybe it's the new design of the iphone5 which has a slight protective lip around gorilla glass). The problem is that the ""Remove me"" tab, which is the only thing you can really grab on to, is only at the bottom, so if you find dust at the top, you either have to do what I did, or pick the entire protector back up from the bottom (which you have already painstakingly aligned) and start all over again. I think a second ""Oops"" tab at the top might not go amiss.At this point, I'm so terrified of messing up the third one and not having a backup, that I've decided just to live with this slightly imperfect result until enough gafarkus gets under it to make it truly unsupportable, at which point I'll take my chances with #3.Otherwise, the product surface is very smooth, and the website helps explain the directions in the package."
0.99967647	0.8212601999999999	Very easy to apply.. Unlike most others!! Instructions were very clear! Protects my screen very well & that includes being dropped into my bottomless pit of a purse!! Delivered very fast! Thank you for prompt service, good quality, and an awesome price!!
0.9530200999999999	0.72936	I screen is nice.  It is thick and does require a need to increase brightness.  I like the feel of the screen.
0.99331355	0.7497587	the screen protector for my i phone 5 worked easy and is a great product - i would recommend it for all
0.9737145	0.64107025	so far so good, i like having the sreen protector on my phone. Only a little tricky to install, good to have 3 in a pack
0.97936964	0.72874904	Love the texture of the case. Fairly a good deal. And purple and green match well. Cant wait for my phone:)
0.98000765	0.7658067	This is my second set I have purchased, first set I bought for my wifes iPhon 5. Fit quite well and no problems there. I am purchasing this second set for my iPhone 5 and can't wait I dislike the glossy finish ones.
0.97700787	0.8574995999999999	Try getting a screen protecter at a good price at a brick and mortar store.  Can't be done.  Bought these for my Iphone 5.  Got three screen protecters for less than half the price stores charge for just one.  Three quality screen protecters for less than six bucks!  Went on very easy, only took five minutes to put on with no bubbles.  No muss, no fuss.  Just line up the screen protecter with the home button and press on.  Can barely tell there is a screen protecter on my phone.  Would highly recommend.
0.9143773000000001	0.52904785	Have yet to drop my phone since replacing so really can't determine how well it will work when put to the test.  It was very easy to install.
0.99960023	0.81823313	I bought these for both my iPhone 5s and our kids iPhone 4s.  They work awesome.  The non-glare / matte finish is great for outdoor activities like soccer and baseball games.  Shipping was prompt.  They were super easy to put on.  I highly recommend and I will definitely buy again.
0.64375067	0.69804287	You get three, the price is right and they come clean over and over again when you clean them with alcohol.  Not overpriced like most people charge for these pieces of plastic!!!  Would buy from them again.
0.15139204	0.5869721	Worked we enough but I had to remove it because it started to peel up when used with a phone case.
0.985857	0.8421049	Really love it. Feels great on finger tips. Doesn't smear. No glare. And protects from scratches. It's exactly what I was looking for.
0.08548784	0.46799165	I was expecting a better quality. There are bubles that I can't remove and it easily gets scratches marks on the surface.
0.15201712	0.36283642	Was too hard to put on and didnt cover whole screen. Got in the mail on time but wasnt what i was looking for to cover my iphone 5.
0.6597626	0.6218119000000001	My wife and I just got iPhone 5s and wanted a screen protector. I tried this one since I only had to order 1 for both phones since it is a 3 pack. I ruined 1 trying to put it on, however, the other two went one well. You can not even tell we have screen protectors on. Love it!
0.8415754999999999	0.62659	I used up the three protectors because all of them tend to bubble up with any speck of dust. The product quality is good, just wish there was a more efficient way for installation.
0.96519196	0.5032283	The product was a good investment people tell me they can't see what's on my screen lol so it reveals the nosey people in the world.
0.15721199	0.6316746999999999	Application was easy and it's relatively inexpensive because you get 3. Other than that this product is only alright. The installation instruction was not that great, it doesn't even say if Tab 1 or 2 is the actual one to put on your phone, you'll find out when you put it on or if you read all the steps first. It's Tab 2 by the way. The squeegee is absolute shit! Using it to remove bubbles will scratch the screen protector like no other, just use your finger to push bubbles towards the edges. 2 days after applying, mine started to peel off around the home button. Look else where, you get what you pay for.
0.0798392	0.50427175	I didn't have any problems getting the privacy shield on. I do like the texture and matte finish of the screen. But the screen is dark and requires me to always have the screen on the brightest setting to view anything. The worst part of the screen is that reading is harder now, the screen seems to be creating noise, which makes the retina screen look really bad.
0.9974383	0.84023666	Great screen protectors that were easy to apply. This is great for not getting prints on the cover of your Iphone. this product sells for over $20 in store but is a a steal online!
0.9650768	0.6831991	Easy to install.  The screen are super clear.  I have to problem install it after follow the direction.  Would buy again.
0.98890793	0.8466214	The screen protector did not reduce the image quality of the screen. Easy to apply. I highly recommend this product!
0.51613665	0.60396564	Usually screen protectors make my iphone look like garbage. Ive used so many - washed out screen or weird glare....However hands down this protector...it looks so natural on my iPhone..you get 3 & they are worth every penny. This company could charge so much more lolIf there are negative reviews here...its because they did not put it on properly or something.STUNNING PROTECTION!!!I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!
0.9995029000000001	0.87721205	I've dropped my phone several times already (I know, clumsy) on various surfaces: asphalt, concrete, hardwood, etc...  This cover does it's job.  Not only does it protect, it's also very sleek looking and allows you to appreciate the beauty of iPhone 5.  I always get compliments on it and usually my friends end up buying one for their phones!  Highly recommend.
0.99840647	0.87710035	I've tried many screen protectors over the years and this one is the best thus far. I used to think Power Support was the best, but for the price and quality of this one, it cannot be beat. I was extremely pleased with the product packaging, instructions, and ease of installation. The screen doesn't bog down response in any way, and you can hardly tell it's there. I love how it's not so big that it interferes if you have a case on your phone- that can be a real issue for some case and screen protector combinations, as the case can sometimes cause the screen protector to peel up in certain places. Not this one. It's perfectly sized where it does not even touch the lip of my Speck Candyshell Grip case. The cutouts are perfectly placed. The screen is easy to clean. Overall, 5 star from me! Tech Armor, you guys make a heck of a screen protector, at a great price! Thanks!
0.9994384	0.8950013000000001	This is an amazing product.  You have to read the instructions and follow them exactly or you won't be happy.  This was my first attempt at applying a screen protector and I messed up my first cover because I didn't read the instructions close enough.  There are 3 layers...the inner layer is the screen protector.  If you try to apply one of the other layers, you will have tons of bubbles.  The middle layer lays on like silk and it is a beautifully clear protective cover.  The package comes with a soft cloth and 2 stickers to be used for removing every tiny piece of dust from the phone before applying.  You MUST do this step before applying the cover.  Very happy with this product and recommend it to my friends.
0.67052186	0.8166585999999999	The Tech Armor product is everything that they say it is -- A good protector, easy to install, easy to remove a perfect fit ... But. It's what they didn't say for it that makes it &#34;Just OK. The nature of the product is that the Anti-Glare and Anti-Fingerprint properties apparently reduce the screen illumination through the screen protector by about 25 to 30%, which in-turn reduces the ability to read the very small print font (particular colored fonts). In optimal daylight conditions, this is not as noticeable as in low light conditions where there is little added front illumination to the screen.I had little or no difficulty installing the protector, as long as I rigorously followed the technical description and video of the proper steps to take.
0.9723799000000001	0.8422009	I bought the 3-pack knowing that the first one is usually a throwaway due to my own install habits. Typically by the second try I get it right and boy did I with the Tech Armor HD clear! Once I got it lined up the thing just sucked itself onto the screen and there was only one tiny speck of dust, no bubbles at all. This is surprising because the past several screen protectors I bought for my iPhone 4 they would constantly bubble along the edge where the screen protector was cut. Not the Tech Armor. This screen protector went on perfectly!Note: For specs of dust, you can take care of this carefully. Take some sticky tape and wrap it around your index finger. Next, get another small piece of sticky tape and use this to raise up the edge of the screen protector where you see dust. Then carefully lift and use your index finger with the tape on it to tap the screen or the protector where the stray dust resides. Then carefully place the protector back down on the screen and push any bubbles out. This process always works well for me to eliminate pesky dust. Just have some patience and you'll get it. It is hard to blame the manufacturer if you install it in haste.5/5 guys, thanks will buy again if needed.
0.9516388000000001	0.67744267	Tech ArmorIt works just fine, and more affordable than many of its competitors.I don't love the way screen feels, not that it feels bad but there are others like Zagg Invisible Shield that I actually prefer but Zagg is more costly so depending on ones budget.  I am keeping the Tech Armor and overall I do recommend it and give it 3 1/2 stars.
0.9905029000000001	0.8507855	Expensive does not equate quality. Tech armor privacy screen does what others did. I used a few brands on my 4 and 4s and recently got this for my 5. It fits and works like what other premium and expensive one does

0.30455992	0.81297207	"Pros:Durable - protects screenMatte finish (but not 'orange peel' texture)Effective anti-glareRemovable and re-positionalCons:Doesn't 'block' screen from view, only reduced brightness/darkensCustom cut out slightly off-centerOccasionally, seemed to reduce touch-screen sensitivity (especially in landscape mode)When I saw this item offered as a privacy screen protector, I was really excited because it boasts ""4-Way, 360 Degree"" privacy for my iPhone 5, and seemed to be a reasonable price. I wasn't sure what type of 'technology' to expect, whether something like mini-blinds (like another popular mfg brand of privacy screen filters), or a combination of blurring and darkening (I hoped for something like many ATM cash machines are now equipped with on the screen, which seems to be 360 degree privacy). Based on the less than $10 price, I purchased two with plans to give the second to my roommate. After comparison to the other certain brand, I can say with certainty that this Tech Armor item does not work the same way.After washing my hands with isopropyl alcohol, the installation on my iPhone 5 was easy enough. I had to reposition it once or twice, but it lifted off easily and laid down again with no problems. The screen protector was slightly stiff (just enough to keep shape), and went down with almost no air bubbles. I had one close to the outer edge I had to squeegee out. Overall, the install was really simple.However, the screen protector I received was off-center a bit. The bottom home button lined up good, and the sides along the edges, but the earpiece and camera cutout were off to one side about 1/8"". It's not enough to cause the screen protector to cover up either the camera or the earp slot, but you can see it's off center when you look at it. I suppose most other people will not be close enough to my phone to ever notice it.Now to the privacy. Like I said before, I wasn't sure what type of 'technology' to expect but honestly I didn't care how it worked, as long as it worked. My hopes were that it would block, or at least distort the view from angles or the side. Well, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. When I turned my iPhone to the side, I could CLEARLY see everything on my screen; it just was not as bright. Without breaking out a protractor, I estimated I had to view the phone almost completely flat in order to not be able to read what was on the screen. While I expected (and don't necessarily mind) that any privacy screen filter would reduce the brightness of the screen, it seems reducing the brightness of the screen is the whole 'technology' that Tech Armor is using to accomplish the `4-way 360 degree' privacy. I can say it does universally reduce the screen's brightness from any angle. When it comes to the privacy portion of this item, there is nothing special about it. It is tinted, and reduces the brightness of the screen. That's all.The screen protector does have a very nice feeling, matte finish (not 'orange-peel' like described for some other brands) that does an effective job of eliminating glare. As for the other one I originally ordered for my roommate, I sent it back for a refund. I have since removed the Tech Armor privacy screen from my iPhone 5."
0.9980972	0.7713474	Simple, perfectly clear screen protector at the right price. Will order again for both iPhone and iPad. Excellent buy. Thanks to Amazon reviews.
0.039946287999999996	0.5265084	took my brand new phone out of the box and immediately put this protector on.it sucks. 3 days later. s***s already peeling off with minimal usage. BOOOOO.
0.99816334	0.7846014	Item is exactly as described. Easy to put on and use immediately .I would recommend this product for anyone needing privacy.
0.9220195999999999	0.7771357	Almost the perfect size.  If you apply it carefully it's not too heard to get it right the fist time. Good price for the quality.
0.0026887655	0.35384864	This is not worth the money. It is complete crap! It does not ever work. Save your time and money!
0.29745793	0.5655849000000001	Bought this privacy screen because a saw one of the Apple store employee's had one and theirs worked very well.  I travel a lot and spend a bunch of time in public airports and train stations, so I would just like to worry less about Joe Blow sitting next to me being nosey and trying to see what I am doing on my phone. I bought this privacy screen hoping to accomplish just that, but it really doesnt provide any privacy.  I can see everything on my screen from any angle, its just a bit darker than if it were head on. If you are looking for a privacy screen, I would not recommend this one, but it was cheap so i guess you get what you pay for.
0.96220326	0.81283736	Unlike other screen protectors, this one seemed pretty easy to put on my iphone 5s. Took about five minutes for the entire process. Only one thing to consider when preparing your phone to put the protector on, I highly recommend that you take the cloth provided in the package and wipe off any dust on the phone. I currently have a little tiny air bubble where dust fell. It doesn't bother me but it's hard to avoid.
0.95792854	0.8351953000000001	The installation instructions were clear and easy.  I've had the screen protector on for about two weeks. It still has a tight bond and functions well. I have not noticed any issues with screen clarity either.
0.15153858	0.55954707	Like the matte, my phone doesn't have the greasy, fingerprint-covered look anymore. I dropped my phone on a gravel driveway and the protector was ruined but the phone's screen was totally undamaged. Will buy again.
0.9862616	0.8207544	Way better than most screen protectors. I've used the cheapest to the &#34;Best&#34; like a zagg.  This is much nicer with a clear screen, durable exterior, not grippy rubbery like a zagg and comes with easy to install applicators.Spend the extra few bucks and get it.Had it on my previous iphone 5 and missed it so I got it back.
0.9647635	0.82772577	"The anti-glare properties of this screen protector allow it to be used outside under direct sunlight, and is hard to smear with fingerprints. Any ""loss"" of retina resolution is negligible. Highly recommended"
0.9983603999999999	0.74177206	This product exceeded my expectations and shipped extremely fast! I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a screen protector.
0.9944271000000001	0.8638402000000001	With this one purchase I was able to protect the screen of both my and my mom's iPhone 5. The protector does take a bit of effort to install correctly, but the manufacturer's website offers easy-to-follow instructions and the effort is worth it. They also include a microfiber cloth and squeegee so that you've got everything you need to install the protector.I followed another reviewer's suggestion of installing the protector under a running stove hood to keep dust away. I don't know how much of an effect this had, but I did not have any problems with dust.I have been using the protector for three weeks now and I often forget it's there. It has no effect on the sensitivity of the touch screen and shows no signs at all of peeling or shifting.Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this to anyone with an iPhone 5. It is VERY cheap insurance against screen damage, especially when coupled with a case that offers a raised lip around the screen.
0.96321225	0.5604395999999999	best screen protector buy it! Recommended for everyone. If you dont buy this than your a jag! So buy it.
0.8765976999999999	0.7227955	Now I can see clearly with no glare when I'm outside! Screen has a mat finish, no more shine. I very happy with it.
0.41358352	0.64289594	Cristal clear and zero bubbles! When i bought it, it didn't indicated that 3 protectors were included; so, this was a surprise.
0.99938464	0.86289656	I just purchased this for my iPhone 5 and really appreciate how easy it was to install. Screen protectors are much easier to install if you apply in a bathroom that has some steam in the air from the shower. This takes all the dust out of the air and allows the screen protector to go on with relative ease.  I have used numerous brands over the years and I highly recommend this one.
0.9778905999999999	0.73053163	The anti glare screen protectors fit my new IPhone 5 perfectly.  Now I won't scratch or mar the screen on my new phone.
0.9981923	0.8033805	I always buy Tech Armor Matte Screen Protectors. Best quality and I love how smooth it makes the screen!Pros:Love the feelSimpleDoesn't show fingerprintsVery ProtectiveCons:NONE!
0.9908613000000002	0.80679643	I bought this screen protector when I bought my new phone for simple reasons at first, it was cheap and came out when the iPhone 5 was released.  The protector does an excellent job preventing people from seeing the screen from all directions. The only downside like another reviewer stated, was that it does show a little bit of the privacy layer in the form of tiny black lines across the screen.  But overall for the price and convenience, this is an excellent product.
0.99133575	0.82943374	Can still see my fingerprints on the screen, but like the anti-glare! Fits iPhone 5 perfectly and attaches very easily.
0.50035906	0.6258191999999999	Putting the protector on was easy but the card provided to smooth out the air holes scratched the protector. And the sticker on the protector left sticky residue on the screen protector when removed. Also cleaning the screen protector with the cloth provided scratches the screen.
0.99909127	0.8598714	The screen protector fit my iPhone 5 perfectly. It was fast and easy to apply. The anti-glare and anti-fingerprint properties of the screen protector make me forget I even have a screen protector on. Very highly recommended!
0.38800555	0.2622879	I trust Tech Armor products because of their lifetime guarantee.  I wrote another review for their Kindle screen protectors without realizing it, and they contacted me to send me replacements free of charge.  I wouldn't buy screen protectors from anyone else!
0.5392093000000001	0.6316201	I bought an Armour Tech matte screen protector for my new iPad mini and thought I'd try it on my iPhone 5 too. Unfortunately, it does blur the clarity you have with retina display and it leaves whitish smudges instead of fingerprints. I liked the matte texture but the screen quality was definitely affected. Otherwise, this applied easily and without bubbles. I should have gone with the clear one.
0.015785933000000002	0.33398923	Very difficult to install. If phone is not brand new you will get air bubbles. Ended up wasting all 3 of them.
0.9885778000000001	0.7249787	This item was just as described and worked perfectly. No need to search for anything else. Thank you for everything.
0.99754626	0.8556783000000001	I have gone through a lot of screen protects for iPhones and these are undoubtedly the best. They don't peel off easily or show smudges like other ones. They also apply easily. Highly recommend!
0.83902377	0.7746779	I had to reposition the cover a few times and even after that I was able to get all of the bubbles to come out after a few days. In non-direct sunlight this is the best screen protector I have ever used. It makes everything look very glossy and HD-esk. Only down side is when using it in the car sometimes it is hard to see the screen if it isn't on full brightness from glare. Overall good screen protector for the coast!
0.18336922	0.48009717	I'm sorry, but I can't give this good ratings at all. You have to have a lint free environment or else the smallest lint will leave an air pocket that you pretty much have to discard the screen protector. I struck out three times. Bought a three pack for my iPad mini and struck out there as well. My old spray on applicator worked a helluva lot better. Sorry but the screen protector with the spray on applicator is better that this.
0.8959147	0.8290624	I had a Zagg on my iPhone 5.  I have Zaggs on several devices and they have always performed very well but the iPhone 5 protector has peeled around the openings twice now.  I decided to go with the Tech Armor Anti Glare because the openings are complete circles rather than open ended cutouts.  The protector was very easy to apply.  I used the cleaning fluid that comes with the Zagg product but any gentle fluid will work to thoroughly clean the gorilla glass on the screen. The directions from tech Armor do not show a cleaning fluid step but I have always found it increases the likelihood of success. Just make sure you don't get in the openings on your device.  Also note that the directions did not apply well to my device as the iPhone 5 protector only has one tab (you only peel off the side that sticks to the screen) but that is a minor bump in the road.  Watch the video on the Tech Armor website as it demonstrates how to lay the protector on the device so it results in a smooth, print/particle free application.  Mine came out beautiful but it took me two protectors to get it aligned correctly.  This is true with any protector so that's not a Tech Armor issue. I liked it so much I bought some for the rest of the iPhone's in my house.I can't comment on durability as I've only had it a couple of days.  If that becomes an issue I will update the review.UPDATE 13AUG2013Ive had this on my iphone 5 for about a month now.  It seems to scratch and scuff fairly easily.  Since mine is a matte protector it doesn't really show while the phone is on but is clearly seen when the screen is black.  This would be a bigger issue if I had the clear protector. Since it is fairly inexpensive and easy to apply I will like just replace it every few weeks unless I can find a better product with complete circular cutouts.  I have revised my rating to three stars.
0.99712276	0.8619180000000001	This product was extremely easy to apply to my phone, no bubbles after using the included smoothing tool. The anti-glare screen works perfectly in bright light and there are no fingerprints. Shipping was very fast and the product was packaged well. Definitely recommended for those seeking an anti-glare, anti-fingerprint screen protector for the iPhone5.
0.9922506	0.7430880999999999	I opted to not pat verizon $15 for their 3 pack screen protectors and get these.When they arrived, they are nicely packaged and has an easy to apply kit with instructions. They have a great video to show how it's done also. I recommend this product
0.9938689	0.80996466	Got this for my wife's phone and was easy to apply and is holding up pretty decent.  I would recommend this product.
0.8120847	0.6349887	I was extremely excited for my screen protectors to arrive. Once they have arrived, I Immediately was going to try to put on the screen protector. I messed up on my 3 try's and I was disappointed, but while I had it on, even though it had some bubbles that bothered me, It looked amazing. Compared to there matte screen protector this one by far is better. I received a replacement from tech-armor customer service! I am so happy they did this! I will patiently and watch the video tutorial to put my new screen protector on. THANK YOU TECH ARMOR SUPPORT TEAM!!!!!!
0.99741536	0.8825917999999999	This screen protector is great for the price and easy to apply, since you just clean your screen and lay it on.  The hardest part for me is lining it up right!  Otherwise it comes with everything you need to put it on - a lint-free cloth, some tape to remove debris, a thin card for removing bubbles, and of course the screen cover. One thing to note - I did a search for a cover for the front and the back of my phone and this came with only a front cover, which was fine, it didn't say in the product description that it came with a back cover, I should have read it more carefully.  I also like that there are three in the pack so if one gets beat up I can just put another one on.  This was also my first experience with the matte screen which does show far less fingerprints and doesn't look glossy like the screen without a protective cover which is good since my son is always grabbing at my phone with sticky fingers.  Very happy with this purchase.
0.9717399999999999	0.7952600999999999	These are tricky to install and it is a good thing they give you a three pack.  I had wasted the first two when I contacted customer service at Armor Tech.  I had originally ordered the HD Clear version and was unhappy with all the fingerprints I saw on the 2nd one.  I told them of my problems and concerns.  They responded in a few hours and offered to sent me a new package of the Anti-glare and Anti-fingerprint protectors.  They arrived a few days later.I got better at the installation and on my second try with the new package received a successful application.  I am happy with the product and very impressed by the customer service.
0.9631656999999999	0.8496822	I recently purchased these screen protectors for an iPhone 5.  Performs just as stated, no glare in any kind of light, and we've yet to produce a finger print.  I mean, yes, if you eat buffalo wings then try to touch, it'll probably create a smudge... but that is to be expected and if it didn't create a smudge I'd suspect black-magic and burn the screen protector at the stake.The anti-glare/anti-fingerprint surface provides a unique side-effect in its design that I find particularly nice; a lightly textured surface.  This really sells it for me.  Think of emery board, dull it up a bit, and it feels kind of like that.  Why do I like this?  Simple, I can feel just how far my finger/thumb is moving, where most give no tactile feedback.  Lets face it, we all enjoy that.  How many times have you shut the forcefeed back (haptic/hapticons) off to save battery life, and it just felt awkward (&#34;did I click that?&#34;)?  That's because we used to and enjoy the tactic feedback.This order came with a 3-pack and lifetime warranty.  I'm sure it's not indestructible, but I do not foresee having to replace this one like I did the last (cat scratched it; the brand Best Buy carries for like 30 bucks/protector).  I also have a Galaxy S3 with a glossy protector (came with my UAC case).  I plan on replacing it with this version Tech Armor for the S3 as well.Only slightly negative thing I can say about this is it does have an effect on clarity *every so slightly*.  They do admit that you should get the HD version if you want *the best* clarity.  Here's the catch-22 though... are you so clean and careful with your phone that you won't get fingerprints on a gloss screen protector?  Further, if you're watching netflix on your phone (or alike), you are probably in an environment where there is glare (not at home, where you have a nice TV you would be using instead).Bottom-line+Anti-Fingerprint Works+Anti-Glare Works+Slightly textured surface for tactile feedback.-Does have slight effect on clarity, but to the extent that a gloss protector would only be better in a static environment (without glare), and you handle it with cotton gloves (no smudges/fingerprints).  Take one of those away, and this screen will win in clarity over a gloss &#34;HD&#34; one.
0.97369313	0.8184973000000001	I ordered this screen protector for my new IPhone based on the reviews of others. I had a slight issue with some residue remaining from the pull tabs and some bubbling. I emailed Tech Armor, had a response within minutes addressing the issue. They suggested that I watch the video at their website regarding application (I guess I should have done this first!), and they were sorry about the residue and reported that they were putting a new set of protectors into the mail the same day. They went way beyond anything I was expecting. I believe this is a great product that is backed by a great company with wonderful customer service. I would purchase another product from Tech Armor in the future. With this sort of customer service there really is no risk! Thank you Tech Armor!!

0.71437496	0.6252264	Since the screen size of the iPhone 5 is still small, compared to the iPad, it is relatively easy to install. Beware of static electricity, which will surely make it hard to keep the screen clean when installing the protector.
0.88844854	0.7060138000000001	I had a HORRIBLE time with the wet type of installation so I went in search of a better way.  I couldn't be happier.  I read a lot of the reviews and got a lot of tips in the process. It's winter in northern Ohio so you can't get around the furnace running which probably means more dust so I DID use the bathroom tip with the shower running but beyond that I followed the directions included and watched the short video on Tech Armor's website. I don't know how long this thing will hold up, but I'm a happy camper right now.  In less than 5 minutes, follwing directions as listed and suggested, made sure I had tape at hand in case it was necessary for missed dust...but I really had no problems.  I will happily recommend to anyone purchasing a new phone or looking to replace their current screen protector.
0.6472361999999999	0.55364394	I am seeking a screen protector for a while and I bought this because of good reviews. However, one major issue --  it turns your iPhone 5 to a iPhone 3.I believe the high resolution screen is the best feature of iPhone 5. The screen protector reduces the screen resolution significantly and you can see &#34;pixels&#34; of the screen, just like a iPhone 3. This is not acceptable.According to the instruction, there is a second label to let you take off the second layer. All three protectors only have one label. I spent one hour trying to find the &#34;second layer&#34;, with a lot of devices without success. Luckly I read one review comment from Tech Armor, says that Matte does not have the second layer. OMG! Why it is in the instruction if there is NO second layer?With the screen protector, the color is washed out, I can not read under the sun light. Without, I can.To be fair, I don't have a single bubble on the screen. The application is easy and smooth.

I dropped my keys straight on the screen and left no scratches on this screen cover--all the other screen covers I've used would have been left scratched!The one issue I have with this particular product is that the package ONLY includes covers for the front of your iPhone. I remedied this by buying a case that covers the back--which most people probably should anyway.
0.9976901	0.8398585	Cheap 3 pack, matt finish, cutouts are perfect and installation is easy.Having the fingerprintless / matte finish is awesome and anti-glare is even better. don't hesitate, so far so good on my iphone 5, it's thicker then your chinese standards you find.not knocking the chinese, people need to get over the days when chinese things are cheap, you get what you pay for. Many of the expensive things you buy are made in china anyways.Take care and buy up
0.97476953	0.69317967	My Granddaughter installed it for me. She said it went on easily. I accidentally ordered the matte intending to order  the clear, but this is working nicely for me. Screen is easy to ready.
0.0052032173	0.47512093	I am meticulous when it comes to putting on these screen covers, and I was not able to get either of the 2 on without bubbles.The worst part is that, if you try to fix a bubble in the middle and unpeel a corner, it slightly bends the corner such that it will not stick at all.  Once a corner is exposed, it basically makes the cover useless because the corner will come off over time.  The cover itself also gets scratches over time and needs to be replaced.Pay a little more for a screen cover that you spray the liquid and slide the cover into place.
0.693615	0.44172645	I took me only one shot to apply this screen protector on my partner's iphone 5 without any bubble. I like the matte finish (but not my partner). I bought another set for my iphone 4s and cannot wait for its arrival.

0.19008768	0.49055165	Came with three and it took all three to get a OK installation on my iphone 5.  I think the main cause was the provided squeegee card didn't help much in removing the air bubbles.In the end, I had to use credit card as a squeegee to remove most of the air bubbles but not all.  I might have to find another clear screen in a few months once I get frustrated in looking at all the imperfections.Nice packaging and installation guide but if I used a credit card at the very beginning I would probably would had a better installation experience.

I had a co-worker purchase a screen protector (one!) for $20.00 when she bought her new phone. I guess I just thought ahead and saved a ton of $$.....thanks! I would recommend this to anyone who needs a screen protector for their phone!
0.9955219000000001	0.81205404	Easy to install and a great price best S/P i ever purchased. No bubbles with this S/P went on correct the first time.
0.9942877	0.7965876000000001	great for protecting the phone and much cheaper than buying it at the verizon store.  I would recommend this product.
0.48457035	0.4707128	My first three attempts of installing this screen protector on my iPhone 5 were failures.Even with their written and video instructions, I still had a hard time installing it.It was too confusing for me.So I ended up emailing them, because they claim that their product has lifetime warranty.I explained to them what happened, and they then sent me another pair of three shields.I watched the video tutorial a few more times, and I installed the product in one attempt. I used the tape that they provided to get rid of the dust. No matter how clean my screen looked before, and after cleaning it with the lint free cloth they provided, I was still paranoid about there being dust on the screen.I'm impressed with how clear it looks on my phone. I use it with the Ringke case I got from Amazon, and it works great with the case.
0.9730251	0.737636	"It's easy to apply if you read the simple instructions. People who gave this 1 star obviously did not read the instructions. For that guy/girl that said ""it keeps slipping off my phone"" probably put the wrong one on. It's not hard to apply at all. I was skeptical at first but I'm glad I chose this one."
0.9587822	0.76241606	These are cheap, work very well and are easy to put on your phone to keep the screen scratch free.
0.09225559	0.4427016	I first bought one of the more expensive ones which was a disaster as it was impossible to place them without hundreds of bubbles forming.  Then I went to AT&T store and got one of their very pricy ones which was horrible as it made the screen fuzzy.  Then I purchased this which was great.  It installed relatively easily and if I were not all thumbs I would still have the 2 extra ones; instead I still have one extra one for future replacement.
0.9933029000000001	0.82054865	this screen cover was easy to apply and I don't notice it on my phone, which is what I wanted.  It seems to protect the screen so far.  It seems this was by far the best product out there for the price.
0.9960793	0.70495194	I just love this product.  Easy to put and no bubbles.  The competitive price is also a big plus.  Thanks.
0.28206214	0.5449218000000001	Very difficult to install on my phone (iPhone5).  I ordered the pack of three for my new iPhone5 and was unsuccessful with my first attempt.  Several bubbles.  I read a review on Amazon to install it under the fan on our stovetop, which I did.  That time, no bubbles in the middle of the screen, but it was off the mark by a tiny fraction, so the lip on the side of the phone created an air pocket which caused a large bubble (not huge, around 1/4 of an inch wide by an inch long).  I will live with this as is, so I can keep the third one for the future.  The other parts of the screen saver are adhering to the phone well and it seems to be a very good product, just difficult for me to install properly.Larry Ellman (larryellman@gmail)  --This was bought for me on a friend's Amazon account, but I am the person that it was delivered to and am using the product (and writing this review).
0.40663564	0.6222026999999999	I guess I got what I paid for.  The screen protector is a bit too small for my iPhone 5 screen (about 2mm off on the long side) and the opening for the front camera was off center.  It smudges really easily and traps dust.  I know for the price I probably shouldn't ask for more, but we all would like to wish that we get the perfect product for less the price right?
0.48296365	0.5838856	I can't stand bubbles under my screen protectors. All it takes is one tiny, unable to see with the naked eye, dust particle, and you have a 1-2mm bubble. I went through all 3 protectors, and had at least 1 dust particle each time. I used the recommended dust removal tape, but I couldn't get them out.I didn't vote 1 star, because they are right about the quality of the protectors. There's no glare/pixel magnification (unlike Invisible Shields), and it feels natural. I just couldn't get the dust/bubbles out. If I had a sterile/clean room, then I could've done it.
0.9365654	0.66972667	what can you say about a piece of plastic. it works and worksvery well. it oays to purchase a good product
0.9949074	0.83156693	Love these screen protectors! They very easily attach to the screen and align much more easily than other brands. The wedge included to squeeze out air bubbles is awesome. The anti-glare is great, especially in bright light and for those who wear make-up, works much better at not picking it up on the screen. Will definitely be ordering again when it's time.
0.8331270000000001	0.65246165	Absolutely love the matte finish! I am definitely not a pro at putting them on, and might have wasted one screen protector, but my phone company put the screen protector on perfect!
0.86848724	0.7340358	i give this a 4 star rating because it is easy to apply and protects your iPhone 5 screen well.i'm quite disappointed in buying this because it does not exactly fit the screen well.  If you're a perfectionist and want this screen protector to exactly fit your iPhone 5's screen, this is not the screen protector you are looking for.I you however are the type of person who wants a reasonable price and just want screen protection for your iPhone 5, this will do just fine.
0.9803184000000001	0.8417982	Not only does the product come with the protectors, squeegee, and cleaning cloth, it comes with anti static tape for removing dust from the screen prior to application of the protector. Crisp translucent material.  Nice and thick which makes for a quick and easy install.  I bought this for the iPhone 5 as well and they were both identical in quality.  I will never buy another brand!
0.456866	0.620879	I purchased this for 2 iPhones I own.  After I installed them they came out great.  I had a bubble in one of the screen protectors and sent an email to support.  I received an email 15min later with some suggestions to fix it and installation videos.  However, the email ended with them offering to send out another one free of charge and if I still could not get it to work to my satisfaction, they would refund my money.  Now that is service!!!  It is a quality product.  Swiping on the screen is smooth and it is great in the sun.  Great product, Great experience with TechArmor.
0.16972551	0.47636288	I have never had a screen protector on any phone before but after i bought this one and put it on i will never go without again. This came with multiple protectors i have only used one and its been on my phone for about 4 months and not one scratch or sign of peeling off.
0.96752506	0.80885416	Easy to install, like the cleaning accessories that come with it. Stuck immediately, no bubbles, doesn't interfere with actually using the phone.
0.98712146	0.79411685	Very easy to apply this screen protector on the iPhone 5. I succeeded once with no bubbles inside. Really recommend this.
0.46661535	0.76783204	I couldn't decide between the Tech Armor and Zagg privacy screens for my iPhone 5 so I bought both. Here are my findings:Zagg privacy screen does not fit the screen. There are a good 2-3mm on either side of the privacy screen where the glass is uncovered. The Zagg privacy screen also doesn't really function well as a privacy screen. The screen was still pretty visible from all angles despite it's claims of &#34;360 degree&#34; privacy. The Zagg screen went on easily enough - no applicator needed, bubbles were easily removed. This thing lasted about 10 minutes before I removed it. Not satisfied.Tech Armor screen was a bit better: size of the privacy screen was cut much nicer and fit the screen perfectly, tho the cutout for the front camera and speaker was kind of misaligned. It functions pretty well as a privacy screen - I'd give it 4/5 stars in this category. I turned the brightness down a bit to 25% and it still works fine. The biggest caveat is that the screen (like the Zagg one above, forgot to mention it) ruins the retina display. The display now looks more on par with my old 3GS - where the iPhone 5 screen was once beautiful and perfectly white, it now displays tiny multicolored specks all over, as if it were wet. I understand this is just a side affect of the privacy screen distorting light at certain angles, but it noticeably changes the way the screen looks. Small text is blurry at best, unreadable at worst. I dunno, I'm going to try using it for a week and see how much I can stand it or if I won't notice it after a while.
0.9767139000000001	0.7320828	I bought this for my Sprint iPhone 5 and had it on in minutes. There were no bubbles and it lined up perfectly. You need to be sure to clean the screen properly and apply the protector slowly, and you will not even notice it is there! I will definitely buy this product again if I ever need to.
0.9979634000000001	0.7799182	Overall Tech armor offer amazing service and negotiate professionally, I am a happy customer especially for their loyalty to customers. I highly recommend them. And the screen protector does fit perfectly due to it being so perfect that why people have trouble putting it on. it very simple get in front of some kind of a light and focus.
0.58532965	0.5486933	arrived. attached it on my iphone 5, works...although i was hoping it comes with a squeegie? that is used to rid of trapped air bubble between the film and the screen.
0.99478805	0.8130778000000001	Its matte finish is exactly what I wanted and the protector actually helped with touch accuracy. I'm happy with it.
0.9123769	0.68555427	just got my second pack today and i notice they made the cut outs for the top camera bigger, thats great because now its WAAAAY easyier to apply.
0.9965911	0.73641604	no orange peel effect, perfect fitment. over all a great product that I will definitely buy again. works really well with my speck case.
0.99898684	0.9356846	I've installed dozens of screen protectors on dozens of devices over the years, and given the highly competitive price of the Tech Armor product my expectations were moderate to low. Boy, was I surprised.I can honestly say this is the easiest screen protector installation I've ever done. No water, no mystical liquids, no chanting, praying, or surgical clean rooms required--just clean the screen thoroughly (the most important step!) and lay it on. Easy to align, easy to pick up and re-align if necessary (and it usually is), and for the first time in my life this protector went down smoothly and bubble-free the first time. In fact, it went down so easily and cleanly it scared me for a moment. And even if you mess one up, there are two more in the package, making these an even better deal.PROS:Excellent fit. When centered, there is a thin line of glass exposed (under 1/32&#34;) all around and the die-cut holes for the button, earpiece and sensors are positioned perfectly.Thin but not flimsy. Thickness is just right, IMO. Touch functions not affected in any way.Extremely good glare reduction without excessive fuzziness-factor. By their very nature. matte/anti-glare screen protectors have the side-effect of softening images. The Tech Armor is the best balance of glare reduction and image crispness I've seen.CONS:The matte surface has a slightly sandpaper-like texture (more like a superfine wet-or-dry abrasive paper) that's a little off-putting at first. I got used to it, but it's still just a little weird (but far from a deal-breaker).While is is certainly not a fingerprint magnet like the screen under it, sometimes there are visible finger tracks on the surface. A quick wipe across my pant-leg usually corrects that.I wish I could think of a third thing to complain about, but I really can't--and the first two aren't really such big hairy deals.CONCLUSION:If you want a matte-finish screen protector for your iPhone 5, quit looking and buy the Tech Armor. You won't find better at any price.
0.99809945	0.86247027	these things are great.  They are very durable. They fit the screen perfectly.  They are easy to apply and easy to take off.
0.48186097	0.6534428000000001	this doesn't work well as a privacy screen you are still able to see the screen from all angles. but it does protect the surface from scratches and fingerprints.
0.97291815	0.754799	Barely looks and feels like its on the phone. Nice cutouts as well. I would recommend this to anyone with an iPhone.
0.9862749	0.78695786	It feats well and does not produce bubbles and protect the entire screen, great product I'm very happy with it, and also the price was very good!!!
0.9992416999999999	0.81414086	Love the case so far. Extremely easy application. Fit perfect and is doing a great job of protecting my phone. Great case!
0.9241950999999999	0.7761933000000001	I have bought several screen protectors and this is definitely on the top 5. I only wish the hole was big enough for the front light sensor. not a big deal since it's clear... but I feel like it takes a minute for my phone to adapt to new light due to the film over it...I would recommend this absolutely
0.005840063	0.2962835	completely sucks! i hate it, dont bother waisting your money on this product, it gets so much air bubbles, it doesnt stick right and the anti glare is the most stupidest thing ever made! i should of got the regular HD protector..
0.48418635	0.51154566	The first time I tried to put on the screen protector I didn't have much success, but it seems to be user error.  After reading my review they sent me a new one with more in-depth directions.  I'm very impressed with the customer service and quality! Thanks!
0.8997738999999999	0.7429249	High product quality. There is a sticky tape to remove the dust from the surface! This is very important!  Have purchased the product is not the first time and very pleased at!
0.03151384	0.45433754	The product came as described.  There were 3 clear screen protectors in the pack.  Unfortunately, I had to use all 3 before I got one to fit and stay on properly.  They were not very adhesive.  With one when I lined up the holes for the speaker and camera it didn't fit the rest of the screen properly and was being pushed up on the side by the protective case I put on the phone.  Maybe some of this is user error but I've never had this much trouble putting a screen protector on.
0.31752855	0.5729233	Clear and easy to apply but leaves a lot of fingerprints so it has to be cleaned often which is annoying.
0.49110177	0.47861782	I have been using the screen protector for over a month now and there are still no scratches in the screen protector. Seems to be high quality.
0.88382435	0.71304	Installation was very easy and the directions were good. The thing that I don't care for is the screen is very easily smudged and really detracts from the appearance of the screen
0.87044835	0.74440134	Tech Armor makes the best screen protectors in my opinion.  They are easy to install and not too sticky to remove if mistakes are made during installation.  They are very similar in feel to having no screen protector on, and they have minimal effect on the screen resolution.
0.9966815999999998	0.82355523	"Just applied my first tech armor anti-glare screen on my I phone 5. Thanks to great reviews on amazon and helpful tips it only took me one screen and a couple of adjustments to get it perfect. It lines up great. I used the lint free cleaner but the saving grace was the ""dust remover"" tape. There was a speck of dust that created a bubble and I was able to easily remove it with the tape they provided. I wish there were three of them to use with the three covers that come with in the package. Thank you tech armor for providing a great product with clear instructions."
0.91314805	0.5918093000000001	Very good purchase. This is the quality I needed! No need to pay double the price for that other leading brand.
0.998886	0.84743285	Looks perfect once installed and the screen feels great when using. Definitely recommend the tech armor screens for the iphone.
0.9878212	0.76222587	"This product was amazing! Usually I have problems with placing screen protectors, and I did with the first one. However the first screen protector is always used as a ""test"". However I placed the 2nd one down and I had some bubbles, but I was able to remove them with great ease. I definitely recommend this product!"
0.9359149	0.652945	Can hardly tell it is on your phone and the instructions on how to put it on is very easy!
0.05868137	0.39870593	Didn't stick to my iPhone 5s, totally not worth it. And the privacy isn't all that good, you have to lower your brightness so it actually is private
0.9990108	0.7850869	Buy these ones, you won't regret it one bit!  Fast shipping, great product, outstanding customer service!  They fit perfectly and go on with incredible ease.
0.99309736	0.83587307	Fit perfectly, no glare or stains as advertised.Definitely a brand to keep for all your electronic devices.Material very durable
0.02686274	0.39287198	way to hard to put on with no bubbles tried all three and over an hour still couldn't get it  bubble free
0.9887301	0.7514104	i love how the package comes with 3 screens.  I was able to install the screen with no problem and it's been working great on my iphone 5 thus far.  No bubbles and it's protecting my phone.
0.9673785	0.7284995	I had a hard time putting the screen protector together, but the service was absolutely amazing. A new set of screen protectors were sent out to me right away and now it's perfect!
0.81853503	0.6763716999999999	No more glare or fingerprints!!! All aps work and I can now see the screen in bright light, just what an iPhone needs!
0.9958452	0.8112509	I used to work in wireless and sell these type of thing for over $30. This product blows away the other ones I've installed. Highly recommend, and the price can't be beat.
0.9903715	0.7670808000000001	This is  a good deal and it works great.  There is little glare at most positions, and its easy to use.
0.9799909	0.69618654	works well even in the case with its own screen protector, most important is the privacy screen which is great
0.6418241	0.5605384	Perfect screen protector and you can barely feel it. The only thing I would like is that it include at least 1 back protector instead of 3 front ones.
0.99804413	0.875556	This privacy protector is excellent at keeping wandering eyes off your text or private photos. Fits the screen perfectly. Easy to apply.
0.9177972	0.73511934	came as ordered and advertised and serves its purpose. I would recommend to other people. it does keeps the sunlight out
0.99606085	0.81475556	The high defintion clear prtoection screen came in handy when the screen needed to be protected from my fingerprints.  It was very versatile.
0.99859023	0.7536924	Thank you for this great product.  My iPhone 5 is well protected.  This is also easy to put on compared to other brands.
0.8249091999999999	0.81451935	This screen is nice. It shipped quickly (in 2 days!) thanks to Amazon Prime. Installation was easy; just make sure the screen is perfectly clean with no dust spots before you begin. As for the quality, a small bubble appeared on the upper ridge of the screen which will not rub out no matter what. It's a good thing that 3 protectors came in the pack. Eventually I will need to attempt a reinstall using one of the two extra screens.One issue became apparent: The screen is actually a little too short for the iPhone5 (maybe 2/100 mm). I lined the screen bottom perfectly from bottom to top and the screen falls just short across the top edge of the phone. This defect enables dust to collect in the tiny gap between the top edge of the screen and phone. This issue results in the one point deduction.We'll see how the screen protectors hold up over time, but overall they appear to be a good value.
0.32595345	0.70041853	"Initially, I was baffled that such a great screen protector sells for such a low price.  After a week, I understood why other protectors cost more.Pros:**Dry installation - unlike wet application screen protectors, you know immediately if you did a good job applying it and you don't need to let the phone sit overnight before you can use it.**Case friendly size - at least the case I'm using didn't have any problems with it** Price** Clear as glassCons:**Smudges - either my fingertips have gotten alot greasier (unlikely) or this protector shows smudges a lot more than Zagg or Armorsuit.  Maybe that's the trade-off for such a clear protector.**Not as slick feeling - my finger really glides on an Armorsuit protector.  This one is not quite that slick.Update:The Zagg and the Armorsuit both seemed to ""self repair"" -- there would be a scratch one day, and the next it would be gone.  Sadly, while Tech Armor does protect your screen, it doesn't seem to handle damage to itself very well.  I had my iPhone in my jacket pocket with my car keys and when I took the phone out, I saw what looked like a small crack in the screen (and an air bubble forming around it).  Fortunately, my screen was fine, so the Tech Armor did it's job.  Unfortunately, I need a screen protector that can absorb damage without looking damaged.I went with Tech Armor because I'm not a fan of Zagg's ""orange peel"" look to their screens, and though I loved the feel of Armorsuit, it was an edge to edge design that would peel off if you tried to use a case.  It looks like I'm still searching for the ideal screen protector..."
0.8634733	0.6285305	I failed miserably with my first try.  If they only included one I'd be back on Amazon ordering another one,  Thanks for adding three in the package.The matte feel takes a little getting used to.  My wife doesn't care for these screen protectors so when I use her phone it's nice and glassy feeling.  But you should see all the scratches on her phone.  We have four kids, it's bound to happen.
0.99095684	0.82590127	The Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector is working as expected. Easy to apply and I have had no problems to date.Does take some effort to make sure that all of the small air pockets are worked out, as with any screen protector.Overall, I will purchase the same Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector's again when I need them.
0.8451290000000001	0.7000985	Packaging was good, items arrived in good condition and not bent.  easy to install.  Both a cleaning and a small piece of plastic to get bubbles out helped alot.
0.97236204	0.8258120999999999	I've used a couple other similar screen protectors, can't remember the brand, but this one is top notch! I'm a real stickler for a crystal clear screen and good clarity. I hate anti-glare types of protectors that make things appear washed out or slightly cloudy. This model has none of that and fit my 5S perfectly. Applying these things is always an irritating process as you try to get it aligned perfectly without a dust spec weaseling its way under there during the process or accidentally touching an edge of it and getting some oil from your finger on it that makes the edge not adhere as well. You have all those problems with applying any screen protector, but one thing I really liked about this one is that it comes with some adhesive strips to touch on the screen to pick up any dust particles after you have cleaned it with the included microfiber cloth. I will say that the cloth leaves more dust residue than what I think you would get from just using a soft cotton cloth, but the adhesive strip pulled the left over dust off the screen and really made for an overall better installation experience. For the price, I think these are very good and I would order again!
0.9721941999999999	0.78600603	The Apple i5 is my first smart phone, so I have no deep history of these screen protectors. I took the advice of other Amazon raters when I ordered the Tech Armor. I can attest to its high quality, precise fit, and easy application using the enclosed tools and directions. The price is much lower than at a store. I have been using it for 3 weeks and am totally happy. Now if I can only figure out all the intricacies of the phone.
0.99779785	0.89656305	I can be pretty tough on a cell phone case and this Tech Armor screen protector is everything I hoped for and more!  My phone is in an Otter Box Defender case, but the screen protector had become badly scratched.  Before ordering a new case I thought I would try this product and I'm glad I did.  I popped the screen protector out of the Defender case, applied the Tech Armor screen protector, then placed my phone back in the case.  Voila! ... it now looks better than new!  Just follow Tech Armor's instructions and the installation is quite easy - my first try was successful.  Also, I highly recommend the anti-glare & anti-fingerprint protector.  There is no loss of touchscreen sensitivity, no loss of color or definition, and it's really great to not see fingerprints all over the screen!  Also impressive is how committed Tech Armor is to complete customer satisfaction!  I didn't need to contact them for help, but they go out of their way to let you know that help and support is available in case you need it.  Bottom line - great product, great price, fast delivery and plenty of support if needed.  Thanks, Tech Armor!
0.9524379000000001	0.7896626999999999	I've tried several iPhone 5 screen protectors and none of them were as quality as these are. I've had this screen protector on my phone for over a week and it still looks perfect. I can't say the same about some of the other iPhone 5 screen protectors.
0.11884138	0.31798303	does this product show off finger prints? i just ordered the hd 3 pack of them. Can someone please let me know

0.045857906	0.38708964	The holes in clear screens did not align properly. They were hard to install on the IPhone 5, because of the way the holes were cut out.
0.9830485999999999	0.7390061	It is refreshing to buy a product that was so easy to use when it comes to this application. The hardest part is just making sure you have it lined up properly. Once applied, there were bare any bubbles and they were easy to fix. Buy with confidence!
0.10902738599999999	0.39031607	Matte finish scratched the first day.  Difficult to apply.  Smallest dust particle will create a bubble.  Used up all three screens with installation issues even after I followed directions and viewed the video.
0.99520874	0.83705306	The covers went on perfectly with no bubbles and do a great job protecting the screen.  What more could you ask for.
0.9852562	0.7337600999999999	I had a friend put on the protector because I was scared to do it myself. But as long as my screen is protected from finger prints and what not I'm happy. Use the wipe to clean my screen. Happy with my purchase.
0.9946226999999999	0.78954387	Easy to put on your phone with the tool kit they included.  the linen free cloth, dust removal tape and little pressing card work perfectly together to ensure a bubble free installation.
0.042594343	0.3886004	I bought this tech armor product thinking it would work well since of all the good reviews on here but it was junk. I bought a Tech Armor screen protector in the past that was bad but thought I would give it another chance and I am upset I did. They use cheap, flimsy screen protectors and I can see why it was a good price. After returning this, I bought a more expensive screen protector and only came with 1 instead of 3 and it worked so much better.
0.8777448	0.6435672	Best privacy screen I've bought yet. You will not be disappointed! I recommend this to everyone, and the best part about it is that I FINALLY bought a screen that didnt get little pieces of dust underneath the screen!
0.99696815	0.83609486	I go through my screen protectors every 6 months or so. This one just arrived and installed perfectly on the first try.  The company has had great materials about how to install, the packaging was clear, and so far it's a good addition.  Also - with a lifetime warranty and a price that is about 1/3 of others on the market... I was glad to give it a try & it's been working great for the last few days!
0.8053998	0.7835976	It took about 2-3 initial starts to get it to lay down correctly. But overall it fits very nicely. You can see your fingerprints and smudges on it, but that's an easy thing to fix by wiping it off. I have about three small bubbles underneath which I believe is from some dust/dirt particles that didn't get removed. The bubbles can easily be pushed out using your fingers, a stiff plastic card, or the one they provide in the package.
0.98606867	0.78260887	Really good at minimizing glare and fingerprints, yet disappears when phone is on. Relatively easy to put on and get all the bubbles out with a little patience. Should have included a plastic squidgy instead of a cardboard one but all in all I am very pleased!
0.9810333000000001	0.82886916	This is a good deal and was easy to install. The screen protector that came with the protective case was impossible to install without bubbles all over the screen. This went on without any bubbles and I have two spares. Can't beat the price.
0.626195	0.53987867	I was't very pleased with my experience using Tech Armor's screen protectors.  After reading many great reviews I decided to give it a shot.  I could not get the protector to apply properly.  My first try was had an air bubble, as I was trying to remove the piece of dust causing the bubble, more dust particles were statically attracted to the film. I scrapped the first try. On the second try I noticed that the holes were cut wrong. I was so happy to find that there was no dust, only to see that he pre cut holes were not cut accurately.  I removed this one and tried the third. Again, bad hole placement.I emailed Tech Armor several weeks ago with this complaint because there was a note in that packaging asking to do that before a bad review. They emailed me back saying that they would be sending me a replacement set. Well...I have yet to receive any replacements, a few weeks later.  I wish I would have just saved my money because I have since purchased an Otter Box that has a built in screen protector. Much better investment.
0.16486955	0.5320009	The protectors seem to work well but time will tell. They are a bit difficult to install correctly. My tip would be to line up the cut out on the bottom for the button and then just keep it even going up the sides. The cut outs at the top for the front camera and speaker don't center but if you have the protector centered on the phone they do wind up in the cut outs just to one side. The hardest part is making sure that the phone is absolutely clean as any dirt or hair will make the protector bubble up and then it is wasted, there are no second chances. We wasted one of them trying to put it on but then were successful in installing them on 2 phones after that.
0.74058324	0.71818674	I first purchased the Zagg Invishield for my iphone5. Big mistake. Those are defective, Best Buy replaced it with the Zag HD, another mistake. The Zaggs don't cover the entire screen and the install done at BB was really shoddy. The Tech Armor HD had good reviews so I tried it out. I ruined 2 but had installation figured out by the third, glad they supply 3. One upper hole is covered but when I called support, they offered to send an updated protector when it is out next week. These fit perfectly,  look great and backed by great service!
0.99851644	0.8154842	Great Product.  Went on easily with no bubbles.Comes with a squeegee for easy application.I will buy more from Tech Armor if I need them.Highly recommend.
0.90392756	0.82046294	I bought this not too long ago for my wife. It shipped quickly and was brand new. The protector is of excellent quality. It doesn't do a whole lot for fingerprints, but at least they aren't as noticeable as they are on the original phone screen. The only complaint my wife has is that she can't see herself when the phone is off. She used to use the screen as a mirror, and now she has to open the camera app to check makeup and such.&#8203;
0.99591994	0.7276168000000001	Fantastic. Love the ease of installation and the professionally installed look. I will get these for all me screen protection needsA++
0.93389976	0.81151426	It was easy to apply (got it on first try with no lint trapped underneath).  It seems to be holding up well after a week of use.  Very high quality and the price is right.  Would buy it again.
0.9639416999999999	0.8258972	"This was totally an ""impulse buy"" when I was buying a case, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.  I had used screen protectors before, but they were terrible.  This one is almost impossible to detect, and installation was easy.  They give you three, which is a bonus if you have more than one phone, or don't like the install.  The cutouts are a little wide, but that's useful in case your install is not perfectly straight.  This is a much better product than I expected and would happily buy it again and recommend."
0.98576975	0.76993024	No issues at all installing. Took about a minute. Just follow the instructions. I hardly even know the protector is there. Perfect fit.
0.9892953000000001	0.8140261	The product is great! It is practically invisible and the display looks great. It was easy to apply and there were no bubbles.
0.99727416	0.72274643	Great product at an awesome price! Tech Armor is a very quality screen protector with a lifetime replacement warranty. how can you go wrong?? Super fast processing and shipment. Thanks!
0.5320644	0.17477646	OK
0.80226535	0.6578312	I watched the video prior to putting on these protectors as well as making sure everything  was clean and ensure that there was no lint. Yet after 3 tries and 3 fails, I had bubbles on all of them. 3 wasted. 7 dollars down the drain. I've done this before on previous phones with similar products and had no issues without using all the ones tit comes with. I am not satisfied
0.9058117	0.6271558	whether you have experience in install new protectors or not, this one is great, it has a guild which you can rely on, also the protector is really HD.
0.805184	0.7518982	It's tough to keep the phone's glass and underside of protective sheet perfectly clean while applying it initially, but once it's lined up and put on, it seems to do its job well.The product website suggests using tape to pull unwanted particles off the underside of the protective sheet.  I read this after I had mine installed, but sounds like a good idea if you have some stubborn specks to remove.
0.99733496	0.83604455	Super easy to install and looks great on my phone. No fingerprints or scratches in my future! It is a must buy.
0.9692877000000001	0.7839444000000001	I put the screen on as soon as I got the phone, so I had no trouble with lint or anything already being on the screen.  It was very easy to put it on, and fit my iphone 5 perfectly.  There were only a very few bubbles, which came right out. Now I have 2 screens left and will give them to any friends, who get the iphone 5.
0.9814284	0.85979015	Tech Armor screen protectors are the only ones that are always accurately described. They're as clear as possible, they don't scratch easily, they lay down nicely. The lifetime replacement is just the cherry on top. They're the only brand that I'll buy from now. :)
0.7960762	0.6995753	For a screen protector that is named to not show fingerprints, these are not worth the money. First they were very hard to put on. I went through all three in the pack before having to just leave the third one. It still has some bubbles in it. Also the protector still shows fingerprints and smears just like the last one I had on. I know this type of protector will degrade the screen brightness and sharpness some, but this did it a lot more than I was expecting and since it still shows fingerprints what is the point. I lost the crisp retina display and still have fingerprints. Maybe I got a defective pack, I don't know but I would go with another kind.
0.21265307	0.53096	This screen protector does not fit perfectly; there's about half a millimeter of space in almost all directions to the edge of the glass. (But it does fit better than the Zagg one I tried first.)I'm glad they include three in the pack, because even after reading all the directions it took me 3 times to get it on without more than two air bubbles. The air bubbles don't get better over time, either.I wouldn't recommend this item, but at least it's cheap.
0.97416383	0.803311	The bad -- conceptually the anti glare/fingerprint is a wonderful.  But for me, after I applied the protector the texture to accomplish the anti properties, caused the screen to be blurry and a bit of fatigue when viewing the screen.The good -- This is the first screen protector that I purchased for my iphone5, and the only comparison I have for application is to the one included with the OtterBox Commuter case.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not get a good application of the OB protector (and will admit partial fault, since it was my first and only attempt), it had many micros dust &#34;spots&#34;.  After reading the instructions with the Tech Armor protector, and following them precisely I had PERFECT installation the first time.The BEST -- as stated I didn't care for the blurriness of the screen.  A quick email to their tech support was returned in about 4 days, with an apology and notice that they would send me at no cost HD clear replacement protectors. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008THTTUI/) for me they work MUCH better, and have come to love the product.  This version applied equally easily, BONUS!!!
0.84261984	0.59415764	No matter how hard you try, you will get a spec of dust and bubbles.  I've used in a literal clean room, and yet can't get a perfect stick.  I've spent a lot to buy a couple packs of these, glad I did because they scratch easy and are hard to apply.  I don't know if I'll get these again.  May just get an otterbox type of case.  Wish I could say something better about these.
0.9906620999999999	0.81126916	The how-to videos really help with the application, especially with what to do when dust gets in there. Very good and well thought out kit.Been living with it for a week, and it's survived keys in pockets and humid bathroom environments. Would recommend to everyone.
0.94562227	0.6513651999999999	greatfast deliveryno problem applicationI bought it because of good review on customer servicebut i nvr needed it, perfect application first time, still have 2 left to sparethanks
0.85673463	0.6942943	I was very careful when I applied it.  i made sure there was not dust on it and carefully put it down one side at a time.  Managed to get it on without any bubbles or anything on the first try.  Works really well.
0.72233814	0.5279037	I like the anti glare feature.  I sacrifice some quality/clarity when watching videos but that's okay, its worth it for its protective qualities.
0.99718803	0.882977	I've tried both matte and gloss finish screen protectors, and tend to prefer matte Assit shows fewer finger print and other smudges. This was perfect,  went on easily and looks great. Visit their website for instructions and video it really helped me out.
0.7824726	0.58469194	A good product.  I liked the packaging and the easy to read labels and directions. I went on the website to watch how to apply the screen protector and I still had bubbles on my screen.  But i think that would happen with any product.
0.9714159	0.77282417	This cover fits very well, better than others I have tried. It was easy to apply to the iPhone 5 glass. Why not 5 stars? Well, it works as advertised, so 5 is too generous for receiving what you expect.
0.8851377	0.7591356	I ordered the anti-glare screen protectors for my iphone 5 and they are exactly what they have described. they fit great on my iphone 5 and give good protection. I prefer the anti-glare as they dont get finger smudges and look clean. Initially I thought they were not cut properly and wasted couple of screen protectors trying to center them. I reached out to their customer service and the agent was kind enough to walk me through the process and explained that they intentionally cut to minimize the effect on the proximity sensors. He also sent me another set of protectors as a courtesy. They really stand by their life time guarantee!!!
0.9854911	0.74141574	I bought this screen protector to replace a much more expensive one that I bought and returned to one of the big electronic stores.  It was very easy to install; no problems completed on first attempt.  And I have 2 more to boot.  I love it.  its like its not there at all.  I would highly recommend it to someone else.
0.9229780999999999	0.6432513000000001	EDIT:  My issue with customer service/warranty was resolved, Tech Armor promptly sent me a replacement and it is working great so far.
0.9898492	0.72899437	Great product had a little issue with install but Tech Armor was very helpful and prompt with a solution. I Would tell others to by this product.
0.34396863	0.5379629	Unfortunately my dog decided to chomp the package of these protectors before I could actually get them on my phone.But the cost and quality seem good.
0.004347235	0.5762550999999999	I bought this screen & within a week the edges started to peel off the bottom of the phone. Also the screen barely adds privacy. The only way for it to really work is if you also turn your brightness down. Completely defeats the purpose. I never write reviews but this one deserves it
0.9936379000000001	0.7354472	geat product.  i'd had problems with other products...this one has been perfect.  used on two iphone5's -- works well with my speck case, too.
0.9761563	0.77114415	Finally, an protective screen I can see at all angles. Not to mention, the soft, smooth feel of it. Shipping was super fast too. The product was exactly what I was looking forward to.
0.94179153	0.685275	Love it fit well on the screen. Price a little hi but will make work out just fine. Thank you
0.9883888000000001	0.84349287	I carried my new screen guards around for a few days because I was afraid of the installation process - I knew what a hassle it was on my old &#34;wet apply&#34; guard.  The Tech Armor was fast and easy to apply - it looks and feels great on my new iPhone5.  I watched the short video online then dived in.  About three minutes later I had a perfect application - straight, tight and no bubbles.  After several days and a few thousand miles it still looks brand new.  I did not think it would be nearly this great because it was so inexpensive but it is a high quality product!
0.97112244	0.76885164	These screen protectors are worth the money. I put one on my iphone 5 and my Wife's iphone 5 and we are both happy. The semi gloss finish is the way to go if you are outside in the bright light often. If you follow the directions that come with the protectors you will not have a problem. make sure to clean the screen and then use the dust cloth provided.
0.9898212	0.7617286	Quick delivery, just as described. The item fit my iPhone 5 perfectly. I liked that it came with three, because I always mess up. Price also much cheaper than at AT&T store!
0.995376	0.8748403	This item was better quality than I expected. The screen protectors themselves were very easy to put on and without bubbles! Also it includes a lint free cloth to wipe down your screen and dust removal tape to get any particles out from under your screen protector. Definitely recommend this product.
0.82976925	0.7624081	Great fit and very easy and quick to apply. Each screen protector comes with a plastic sheet on either side (marked 1 & 2 so you know which one to remove first) which keeps the product scratch free (Nice!). Each package includes 3 screen protectors, a cleaning cloth, a squeegy (hard cardboard) and instructions. I am not very coordinated and my first try resulted in 3 air bubbles when I dropped down the final edge. Only 3 bubbles is good for me and they were easily pushed out to the edge with the provided squeegy. My first try was a success! This leaves me with 2 extra screen protectors for future use.
0.98290884	0.75290465	Was supper easy to put on. Lasts a long time too. I will be purchasing this same product in the future.
0.23627764	0.44414148	The product is good however it did not come with any directions or the squeegee to push out bubbles.  There also was no dust removal tape included.
0.6659339	0.5812282	Expensive for a few sheets.
0.99884486	0.8520406999999999	I am just thrilled with this cover!  Fits perfectly, was easy to apply, comes with the cleaning cloth and card to smooth out the bubbles.  Great price for three of them.
0.99247956	0.76256526	the screen protector goes on nicely and doesn't crinkle up like others. The instructions were nice too and installation was easy. Thank  you!
0.88100815	0.5546776999999999	Glad they include 3 to a package, because no matter how hard and how careful you are, it takes the third one to make it perfect!
0.97973967	0.79730225	Was easy to apply and works great. I previously had the &#34;mirror&#34; screen protector on my iphone 5 and had to remove because the glare was horrible. Changed to this one and have had no complaints!!
0.53422636	0.59102017	I WATCHED TO THE VIDEO TO SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO APPLY THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR...THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT VIDEOS ALL SHOWING THE SAME THING...ONE TAB IS GREEN...THE OTHER RED.  THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I ORDERED IT.  WHEN THEY ARRIVED BOTH TABS WERE BLUE AND WHITE AND I COULD NOT TELL WHICH ONE TO USE FIRST.  NATURALLY I DID IT THE WRONG WAY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE...THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE GREEN AND RED TABS SO PEOPLE OVER 50 OR WHO WEAR GLASSES DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS APPLYING THE SCREEN PROTECTORS.
0.9335519	0.7610906999999999	This product was just what I wanted. It is easy to install on the phone and nearly unnoticeable on the screen. I would certainly recommend it.
0.5181898	0.5161915	Card scans can not read the numbers, so I still have to carry key fobs, even though I am using Card Star.  Always having to wipe off screen due to residue.
0.94719875	0.5123425	This product was exactly what I thought it would be. I look forward to doing business with this merchant again in the near future
0.0034206212	0.6198831	This is a piece of garbage.  It completely shades your screen setting the device back 3 generations.  It also unpeeled within a matter of days.  Avoid this product at all costs.
0.9751066999999999	0.7319126	Looks beautiful on my Iphone 5. NO bubbles or hassle just follow the steps and its easy as 1 2 3!
0.51184535	0.5769257	I am happy to have this screen protector. It was not difficult to apply. I watched the video and applying is fool proof. I like not having fingerprints or makeup prints on my phone. I do sometimes feel I need to touch the keys with more pressure when texting but it is not a real problem.
0.35421783	0.6559625	Used up all three already and they all had problems with the incase slide on. Dust and skin got under the protector. Bad brand.
0.017073243999999998	0.42944738	Very disappointed. I watched the video and read the reviews carefully. I washed my hands before starting. I cleaned as recommended. There must have been something wrong with the stickies to get the dust off because it left a huge glue streak on the glass of my Iphone 5s. I had to use several products to get rid of the huge streak and it ruined the cloth that came with the product. After cleaning again I tried putting on the first screen, it was filled with bubbles that I could not get out. Long story made short I ended up wasting the first and second screens, the cleaning cloth was ruined and I finally got the third screen on, it only has a few air bubbles and I am hoping they will dissipate after 24 hours. I now have no cloth to clean the screen with it is sticky from the glue residue from the back of the dust cleaning strips that were in the box to use before putting the screen on. I am so disappointed. The one that is on now look pretty good, however, I should not have had to use up two to get one that looks right and my phone screen should not have become streaked from the old glue from your dust remover pieces of cardboard or whatever you want to call them. I think I should be sent a replacement set sent for all the problems I had with the saver. Once I have to clean the first one I do not know what I am going to do.
0.9982078000000001	0.8524666	Looks and fits my new iphone perfectly. Easy to apply and I can read the screen in the bright sun light.
0.9915389000000001	0.82472074	This screen protector with privacy feature was very easy to install.  No bubbles to deal with.  Fits well with the plastic case on my iPhone 5 also.
0.9976349	0.7586474	works great & great price! very important to apply in a bright sunlit room. I will purchase again in the future.
0.9258715000000001	0.6872329	I am pretty happy with the product. A bit pricy I would say; but still much better than the other screen guards.
0.34974772	0.56106126	this item gets scratched easy.. the phone doesnt but u need to replace the screen pretty often. hence the 3 stars
0.9856739999999999	0.6522819999999999	It works like any screen protector. Seems more protective and easy to install. Also receive the items in time allotted, Thanks.
0.27741593	0.5819116	Causes slight screen noise to look at but serves the purpose and easy to adjust to just turn up brightness
0.31782693	0.50235265	It serves its purpose. Its not an exact fit on the top for the Iphone 5 ear area which should be noted.
0.32523412	0.66157556	This screen guard is a good quality overall, but the main CON is the positioning of upper cut (microphone). It is too long and isn't centered, so once its attached, your phone looks awkward. I would give it 5 stars if not for that detail.
0.94530815	0.8174389	It was easy to put on, no bubbles. The anti-glare works well and does not finger print up. It has a nice smooth feel to it as well.
0.98975575	0.7730041999999999	This screen cover has a great feel to it.  I recommend going to the company website for instructions on the best way to install it on your phone.  I got in a big hurry when my package arrived and just put it on my phone straight away.  It would have been better to follow online instructions, but even without that, it is on and working just fine.
0.9855412	0.7077446999999999	this fits the iphone 5 . was easy to put on , and works well. i think it will do its job.
0.96381295	0.7738615	Really does reduce fingerprints and general oiliness from face/hands, etc. I like the matte finish. protects very well from scratches.
0.99094594	0.8174683	The instructions were clear (even included a link to a video), the protector was easy to apply, and it has worked well so far.
0.99357647	0.75579405	Great screen protector, very easy to put on, smooth and not hard to handle will tell all my friends and family
0.9924288	0.81433225	This case was not the easiest to apply but once I got it lined up and on the phone there are no bubbles (first time ever for me) and I love the feel of the protector on my screen. I have used some other &#34;nice&#34; protectors and lots of cheapo ones and this is the best I've used. The only complaint I have is a small scratch on the protector from something, probably keys in my pocket... Changes the look in a spot. Nothing compared to what I'm used to with others though, this protector looks much better.
0.9854736999999999	0.8096708	very pleased with these protectors, first one went on without bubbles, very easy to put on, after application it disappears like its not even there!
0.9887623999999999	0.72765994	Do you ever get the feeling people on the train are looking at your phone, while you are reading an email, watching a movie, or even playing a game. Well, I am here to tell you that Tech Armor can stop all of that! Now you can continue to use your phone and not worry about some stranger looking over your shoulder to see what you are doing.
0.93895364	0.8016068000000001	Screen protector works great.  I watched the video on how to apply,  then experienced one problem.  Both print material and video described two tabs to remove from the screen protector but my product had only one tab.  Researching Tech Armor's web site I found that anti-glare protectors only come with one tab.  The original directions omitted this information.  I followed the installation steps and had no problem applying.  I was very careful to line up the protector with my phone's screen and the result was a very good fit.  I like the anti-glare result when I am outdoors and it doesn't show finger prints.The protector has been on about 3 weeks and so far it looks flawless.
0.9360759	0.71976215	This is the first time I have ordered Tech Armor.  Like all screen protectors, I can never manage to get all of the air bubbles out.  This was competitively priced and easy to use.  I have only had my iPhone 5 for six weeks but this screen protector is holding up well.  I would buy these again.
0.12141645	0.43017414	No one can see info on my phone but me & sometimes I can't even see it until at a 90 degree angle.
0.98999214	0.86591697	This thing went right on no problem!  Even better...I wasn't sure about the matte finish as I've always used glossy screen protectors. My advice is - GO for it.  The matte finish doesn't show finger prints, and has much less friction so your fingers will slide swiftly across your screen while texting.Best screen protectors I've used yet.
0.9938549999999999	0.81695807	Quickly installed and had no air pockets or bubbles. Highly recommend product and at @ 2 bucks a piece, what a deal.
0.99924284	0.9008404000000001	Absolutely the best non-glare screen protector I have used.  As a person with low vision, I am now able to actually read my screen even in bright sunlight and glare. This is truly a benefit. I have dropped my phone twice and had my house keys rub up against the screen while phone was in my pocket.  Zero damage in both cases, i highly recommend this purchase.
0.79128176	0.6551151	I am may be challenged at getting these on with nothing underneath them but it works well and there is more than one to make a mistake.  Would purchase again.
0.9935298	0.77761513	Works as a screen protector should, already saved my phone once from what should have been a massive scratch. Such things happen when you put car keys in the wrong pocket. Very happy with this purchase and arrived earlier than estimated.
0.9934159	0.80847853	My wife owns an iphone 5 and I own a galaxy s3. I have owned many androids and my wife had many iphones. Everytime we get an upgrade, my task is to purchase and install the new screen protector. I have tried many different kinds including Armor Suit and I have to say that Tech Armor HD beats the competition. I installed it on my wife's iphone 5 the other day and I had no bubbles. What really impressed me was that after installing it, it was hard to tell that there was a screen protector on. It didn't hinder the crisp, bright picture on the screen. I liked it so much that just ordered one for my galaxy s3.
0.98476404	0.7523696999999999	Fairly easy to install... definitely a good thing to have on my iPhone 5... protects against scratches and cleans easily.
0.9851502000000001	0.650354	3 screen protectors and they are clear,work great and have an oh so sweet price. Thank you for not gouging customers like other brands.
0.7091812	0.65628475	I was able to put it on in less than 30 seconds and no bubbles, and I was pretty drunk at the time, no problem.
0.9286211	0.77904016	Easy to put on the phone and protects my phone from scratches!  I was also excited to see that it came with three screen protectors instead of one.  All the other screen protectors cost significantly more money, so I feel like I got a bargain.
0.40316498	0.6294998	the first one i applied didn't work so well - but the second time was a charm.  no bubbles no dust - it's like it's not even there...
0.9905568000000001	0.7764009	Have no problem with this screen protector very easy to install and privacy is great!! a Must buy i actually just ordered another one
0.030837833999999998	0.4962545	The Matte finish is exactly what I have been looking for but it's not the quality I want in a screen protector. Scratches easily in areas mostly touched and I always have short finger nails (would imagine it's worse for girls). This could live with; if it wasn't for the random bubbles that would show up that you just cant push out. I have 3 bubbles on my phone and living with that until it gets worse and I have to replace it. At least they send 3 screen protectors because you'll use them all.
0.48328748	0.6224251000000001	I've had an iphone for years, and just upgraded to the 5s, so needed a new case and screen protector.  My last phones screen protector lasted me the years I had the phone with no issues.  This one is already scratched and I've only had it a week, and handle the phone with kid gloves because its new, so its not like I am rough with it and would ever expect a scratch.  Aside from the scratch, the screen protector is terrible when it comes to fingerprints!  Obviously need a new one, and will not be buying this one again!
0.9945132999999999	0.8358183000000001	I have always used these Tech Armor Screen Protectors, I prefer the HD Style for the clarity it provides. Fit is good, and protects screen from scratches and children!
0.9054934000000001	0.73846066	Easy to install with no bubbles.  Have used the phone for only 3 weeks but don't anticipate any problems with the screen protector in the near future.  Hopefully I will buy a new phone before I every need to change the screen protector.
0.43380728	0.5545434	This screen protector is so so blurred. It is destroying the  clear visibility of the phone screen. and can see the fingerprints too.
0.9965099000000001	0.74816066	Nice fitting, easy to install screen protector, works will with the Otter Box Defender Case.  Bonds well to the screen.  Highly recommended
0.013441235	0.33509037	Concept is good, but it kept bubbling up -so I don't use it. Kept cleaning the screen & putting it back on - never got it to fit correctly.
0.9600351999999999	0.69904923	I researched a lot on screen protector and then purchased this one. It turned out to be an excellent purchase and if you follow instructions step by step, you will end up with ZERO bubbles on the screen.
0.315404	0.40995586	Screen protector works as described, but installation was a nightmare. On line video wasn't much of a help either. Most products in this category have the same issue re: installation....
0.10504937	0.32297105	I gave them 3 stars because of the life time warranty... though I don't think I will use it, ever.Screen itself is alright but the film size is much smaller than the actual iphone5 screen.
0.9965351999999998	0.8580708	Are all screen protectors alike?  No.  This one went on easily with no bubbles, had clear, accurate, directions (not like the one which mis-labelled the front and back of the protector).  First time, hassle free installation of a great protector is definitely a winner.  And the protection is there, but no obtrusive.  Excellent Product and great service.
0.25500077	0.48248827	The product shown online is different than the one which I receivedproduct quality is ok and if they sell the same product which they show then its worth
0.18767324	0.37253225	Not needed, just makes the screen feel sticky.
0.9968581	0.82428735	Product arrived on time and was really impressed with the overall experience.  Came with 3 screens and got my 1st screen on with no problems and no bubbles.  The HD screens are nice as they don't distort the beautiful glass display of the iphone5.  Screen fit perfectly with nice cutouts for camera hole.  Case friendly too as I use a bumper.  Great product and would buy again!
0.77203834	0.6201709	"I will say that I really like that they give you 3 screen protectors, as I went through 2 to get it right.  Turns out I'm not that good at following directions or counting, so I could have had done it with one =PYou simply peel off the tab marked ""1"", roll it onto the screen, press out all the bubbles, then remove tab ""2"".  If you try to do it backwards as I did, you will never get all the bubbles out, nor get it to stick, as there is a difference between the 2 sides.  So just pay attention.  Once I got it right, it went on and there wasn't even a need to press out any bubbles.  It is like it's not even there, by far the best screen protector I've used on an iPhone (this is my 3rd iPhone).Highly recommended!"
0.9685315000000001	0.7627198000000001	Doesn't leave any scratches on the protector and come with lifetime warranty what more can you ask for. Easy to put on without bubbles.
0.99535346	0.8483273000000001	This screen saver is the best because there was no visible fingerprints only  one air bubble that could easily be smooth out. I would highly recommend this screensaver to anyone.
0.6556904	0.6205932	The price could be maybe 20% lower or so but these are great quality and accomplish what I wanted them to do.  It comes with 3 of them obviously, but I had to use all 3 because I screwed up the first two... I really hate applying these things (I didn't have that much more luck with previous / other brands I purchased.  The instructions were actually really good and thorough, I just felt lazy at the time and didn't feel like reading them since I had put these one before.
0.9587872	0.7594739	This was easy to put on the phone, and seems to be protecting very well. I don't notice that it is even there.
0.99741507	0.7481852	The order shipped really fast! Applying the screen protector to my phone was easy and no bubbles! Great service! Great product!
0.98452324	0.7528765000000001	I love these covers, they do protect the screen.  Best part once the cover gets old you just replace it.
0.010914385	0.38991192	These things don't even stick to the phone!  I went through the whole package in an afternoon because they wouldn't stick!
0.9623710999999999	0.8072076	doesn't get beat up easily, easy to put on and the warranty is great. I recommned this to anyone that wants a matte protector. Although it does lower the quality of the screens display, I prefer matte protectors because it doesn't tug on your fingers because it is very smooth.
0.99017715	0.7376934	Nice product. Easy to use. Very clear. Exactly as advertised. You have a second one for back up if necessary.
0.88134354	0.67190534	Works as expected, makes having the phone to one's face not a bad alternative in communicating well worth the price!
0.9935688	0.7814613	I love this screen protector.  Easy to apply, no bubbling if you follow instructions.  Much better than my super-expensive anit-glare HD screen protector from another manufaturer.  I would recommend and buy again, but I still have 2 more protectors in case something happens to this one.  A++.
0.49058744	0.66217685	This is alright. I ordered two packs, so I received six screen protectors. The way to put it on is annoying because it isn't in the PERFECT position, it WILL cover up your camera. Right now I have it on, but now my homescreen button is partly covered which annoys me. However other than the fact it may cover your homescreen button a tad, it is VERY clear and you can barely tell it's there.
0.12961909	0.5415	Few scrtaches after 3 weeks, not the best I have seen.
0.94029164	0.5534727	Easy to use, 0 problems, i'm happy with the final result, and the best part is that i have 2 more just in case, very good.
0.9670200999999999	0.62405	i would really recommend this too all my friendsgreat quality and it really looks like if its High Deinition
0.7795062	0.6852461	I really like it. As specified it came up with 3 of the screen protectors and a cleaning cloth. Installing is little difficult, but will work as you have 3 of them. Even you mess up with one of them other will serve. My suggestion is to read the manual careful before putting it on your phone.
0.9993979	0.865175	Applying these things always puts me in a bit of a panic, especially when it is for a brand new, shiny device.  Will it bubble?  How will I keep the dust out?  I received these screens promptly, gritted my teeth, held my breath and braced for the task at hand.  I read the instructions and watched the very helpful online video it recommended, and I did it!  It fits perfectly, all bubbles were easily squeegeed out, and a little tape (as recommended) solved the dust problem.  It fits perfectly, and shines up nicely.  My new, shiny device is still shiny, but now it is protected.
0.9465712	0.74958783	This screen looks and works great on my black iPhone 5 along with rubber feeling case. My wife has white iPhone and matte finish doesn't look as well there. This is the only reason I give it 4 stars. The customer service of Tech Armor is top notch. Missing package was immediately replaced with new shipment.
0.22189707	0.53216755	These really cannot be used on the iPhone or any other phone. Lots of bubbles. I liked nothing about these.
0.9951128	0.7450116	My husband is very very happy with this product. It does exactly what it says and yes he recommends it 100%
0.97835475	0.60056186	No problems here. Good product and much cheaper than the alternative. Will buy again in the future. Three more words.
0.99587846	0.8704876	Since I've been buying smartphones and MP3 players, I've always used screen protectors.  Don't be fooled, NOT ALL ARE THE SAME!I've swung the pendulum both ways, used the cheap protectors and used the expensive ones too!  I've found that the best ones are right in the middle.  Every time I buy new ones for either a new device or the protector gets scratched, I buy a different vendor.  This time around, I tried the Tech Armor ones.  (I bought this for my 5 and the HD Clear for my wife's 4s.)My process for applying these is simple...  Remove the old one (I use a folded piece of scotch tape, push down and pull off), clean the device with rubbing alcohol, wipe with the anti-static cloth and apply.  However, it seems that there's always dust flying in the air and specs get trapped under the protector.  (Sometimes I wish I had a clean room in my house.)However, in applying the clear one to my wife's 4s and the matte one to my 5, both installed perfectly without any bubbles or trapped dust.Though I didn't need it yet, these come with a lifetime warranty!  (However, I did buy a 3-pack so I have spares.)From here on in, I'm buying Tech Armor protectors!  Amazing...  Just amazing!
0.974001	0.7711779999999999	I have tried several different screen protectors over the past several years. I have found the Tech Armor screen protectors to last longer and (when applied correctly) leave very little or no bubbles at all. I have tried this product on all iPhone products and I can strongly recommend this product to anyone.
0.9973449000000001	0.8109645000000001	I love the anti glare. Finally a screen protector that doesn't come off or peel... No bubbles that u can't remove. I love this screen protector and even bought it for the Samsung galaxy s4. Great buy for the price! Can't complain at all bc it's perfect. Best screen protector I've bought thus far for the price. Very satisfied. Shipping was efficient and quick.
0.14366767	0.25531203	i really like how it was but you could not have any case on your iphone 5 so if you are going to buy it do not use a case
0.96130323	0.7733501	This is a very good product.  I bought it for my husband's new iphone 5.  The only problem is that he put it on the phone without cleaning the screen.  I've had to control myself as I want to take it off and reapply it!  Not only can I see fingerprints underneath it, but he left bubbles all over!  I love him, but he gets an &#34;F&#34; on clear screen application.
0.3448275	0.5416286	This was easy to apply and it seems to be anti-glare and anti-fingerprint to a point but I'm just not happy with the grainy pixelated look to the display with this on. I went with the anti-glare based on the high reviews but I think a clear protector would be better. I will probably remove this.
0.0076313615	0.49089468	WORST PROTECTOR EVER - COMES OFF WITH ANY CASE AND BUBBLES UP SO EASY  CLEARLY THE CHEAPEST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET
0.21522793	0.5845011	It is anti-fingerprint and anti-glare, that much is true. It is easy to install, and with a little care it leaves you bubble-free. It does not fit well - while it does not block anything, the holes do not match well, and the whole thing is too small to cover an iPhone 5 from edge to edge.Now the worst, forget about enjoying your new pretty retina display with this screen protector. It looks horrible, there is no amount of self-convincing that protection of the phone's screen is a good thing that could make me keep it on. While it did cut some glare, it was more like desaturating the screen with light reflections getting bounced around in all the tiny crystaline structures of the protector. Which effectively killed all the richness of the retina display...I took it off after a week and threw it away.
0.9933341999999998	0.8598349000000001	Easy to apply following the tips & demonstration in the video. Looks nice on my iPhone. Does not add bulk or change the looks of  the phone. Works well with the slim phone cover I purchased recently. I would recommend this screen protector.
0.9850789000000001	0.812317	It does exactly what it should: it fits perfectly, goes on easily, and there is no difference in performance. Added plus is its slightly matte finish, which cuts glare and reflection nicely. Make sure you work in a dust-free area and have the screen and your hands super clean. Nice that it comes with 3...these should last a long while.
0.93619734	0.70531917	I purchase this screen protector because it provided anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. It is the best screen protector that I purchase.  Price right!
0.47091144	0.43271750000000003	"I know, it says ""screen protector"", but I guess I have always purchased full body kits.  I was surprised to find only the front cover in the package.  Just an FYI.  Now I need to find the back side..."
0.9716268	0.77676934	This is a well made, reasonably priced protector sheet. It fit my iphone 5 perfectly and their was not degredation in touch performance.
0.95630956	0.7975818	A good product really worth its price. Easy to put on the iphone and protects the screen well. Have it on for several weeks and still looks like new. Be careful with you last step in the instructions, I wasted one of the sheets by not being careful.Dmitry, Belarus
0.9913702	0.8332643	These screen protectors were easy to put on and are super clear. Doesn't even look like you have a cover on your phone. They are so much cheaper than the ones from Apple or ATT. We will definitely buy more of these when we need them.
0.9945463999999999	0.69943905	This works fine for my needs.  I had no problems applying, and haven't had any issues since.  I would recommend this.
0.24179676	0.47332179999999996	The screen protector is transparent, but this is probably the only positive feature. Touches leave greasy traces, sensitivity decreased... I am disappointed. The delivery through Amazon is great!
0.95985353	0.7369126	I love it.  Wasn't sure if I'd like matte finish on the black iPhone, but I really do - it makes the front of the iPhone look like the back - a nice sleek black matte finish.  Best of all, no more smears or fingerprints!
0.9997530000000001	0.8949405	It is great and does everything it is intended for. i mostly like the texture which is hard to describe,, almost like a matte finish for your screen. i like it most for preventing fingerprints. iPhone glass is pretty good at preventing many prints and smudges but you cant beat this.. and for the price, this is $14 at Target and $18 at Radio Shack in San Joaquin Valley, CA (for pricing) but for 6-7 bucks its the best. One thing is some people who freak out over, their screens HD quality this does hinder it  just slightly. not dramatically as in the photo but you know what product you're buying, you should only expect it. I will say i have also bought the clear ones. they are absolutely amazing as well. they do exactly what they're supposed to and the image quality stays great. Best screens and brand for screens i have ever come across. Highly recommended! (^_^)
0.59210634	0.5651376	Perfect fit, looks nice on phone, $2 each, lasts forever ( almost a year one oneand i dont need to change it yet) very strong, crystal clear. Easy install.First I Spent $25 on a Zagg the only brand Best Buy carried in stock.Poor fit of cutouts. Wet install looks like you put this thing on ina swamp underwater, no joke. Replacement is not free, will costa fee. Bad install not covered. Brought it back to best buy , and innext customer service line was a lady returning a Zagg for an Ipad. LOL.
0.0318318	0.527144	Thought this would be a nice addition to my phone, but as soon as I put it on it really ruined picture of the screen. If you think you'll have a clear view of your screen, or any pictures/video you take or view on your phone, you're sadly mistaken. I was hoping to create some privacy on the phone, but not at the expense of screen clarity.I read some reviews and thought it sounded like a great deal, but as soon as I had it on my screen the resolution became awful and I removed it immediately. Not worth the money. Extremely let down by this product and won't be buying another any time soon.
0.7788906999999999	0.7773456999999999	I really loved this product. The box comes with three and they are super easy to put on.  I recommend everyone get this if they want to keep their phone in mint condition.  Something to be aware of is that this screen protector is slightly fogged so you will not be able to see your reflection when looking into the phone.  It isn't very noticeable but I didn't realize this upon buying it.  It can also be slightly noisy when you rub your fingers on it but its really not a big deal. For ladies that wear makeup this is a good product for you because your makeup won't show on the screen.
0.9345366	0.39885774	I have hated using my iPhone in class because my friends could see what I was doing. Now I don't have to worry about it anymore!
0.99744487	0.78431445	In my opinion, this is the perfect cover for the iPhone. Smudges and glare are just shy of being non existent. Personally, I've always preferred the feel of matte covers over that of glass, specially after continuous use. Add to that the fact that it comes with three covers for an amazing price. It really is a great buy. Highly recommended.
0.10235810000000001	0.48439783	Purchased this screen protector for my phone.  Watched the video on the tech armor website to insure proper installation.  All three of the screen protectors had either lint or bubbles that wouldn't come out on them.  Had to throw away all 3.  Not very happy with the purchase.
0.9763995000000001	0.76304555	Just make sure your screen is perfectly clean before applying. Very easy to remove - no marks or residue left on the screen.
0.9992970999999999	0.8442301999999999	Product as advertised.  Eliminates glare and fingerprints.  Bonus is the very easy installation.  Beats all other screen protectors on installation.
0.9307690999999999	0.7099819	Cristal clear image, good quality and the cutouts were aligned with the iPhone 5. No bubbles at all. Good product.
0.9913846	0.8066895000000001	I have been using this screen protector on my iPhone5 for about two months and it works exactly as promised -- no problems.
0.96623087	0.66920775	Good product so far. Have had it on my phone for almost a week. The pack came with 3 but I only needed one. Surprised actually that it only took me one time to get it perfect.
0.4569177	0.5478771	My initial try to put these on was not very successful. I used all three and still ended up with a few bubbles. I didnt contact the company, since I figured it was my error. I posted a review on Amazon and mentioned my difficulty, and less than 24 hours later I received an email from Armor Tech telling me they wanted me to be completely satisfied and were shipping me out a new set. They shipped them the next day on Saturday. Now THAT's customer service!
0.0023338199	0.33846933	Not a fan of this product. I kept getting air in between screen and protector. I ended up using all three with no success. Threw them out. Total waste of time and money.
0.51442885	0.7138300999999999	I bought this based on the good reviews. I failed to install the first two and have the third one on my iphone. The protector fits the iphone 5 screen nicely. However, I put my iphone with my keys in the same pocket and there was a little hole and air bubble around it after that. I emailed customer service and they do respond really quickly. And they will be sending replacement soon. Great customer service!
0.9226078999999999	0.68698156	Easy to apply,no problem getting bubbles out. I was able to apply the product with one try, only had to use one protector. Quick delivery.
0.9983783000000002	0.8525639000000002	Very happy with these screen protectors.  Well worth it.Comes with extras too, unlike many out there.  I am veryhappy with this purchase.
0.9886105	0.8131130999999999	Went on easy without air pockets.  Works well and looks good.  Better than the one supplied by the case manufacturer.
0.88834524	0.8055180000000001	I am not a fan of screen protectors.  But after a scratch on my new 5S, I decided to try this.  It was inexpensive and got great reviews.  It took me a few tries but after a perfect fit, you can hardly tell it's there.  It feels like glass.  It does not reduce clarity of brightness.My tip is to use scotch tape to lift it up on both ends to move it to the desired centered position.  If you have dust under it, again use scotch tape to lift up the sides, then use another piece of tape to remove the dust.They give you 3 screens which is what you'll need after the first 2 tries.  Use the tape method and you'll only need one.
0.9908165000000001	0.6119174	I bought this as a gift for my son who is in the military. He loves it. Perfect fit. Ordered & shipped out immediately.
0.30023059999999996	0.50210017	Screen gets scratch so easily it's looks so bad I wouldn't get it again shipping was great but not the screen
0.99049115	0.64825666	I love my protection privacy screen. I don't like everyone in my business and this helps me keep it that way.
0.43072146	0.46817052	good protector but took all 3 to get it on correctly and watch out for bubbles near edges and does not come with squegee...over good product but hsould come with better instructions
0.42826763	0.6550335	It's not that the product does not protect; but the cut-outs on the front top only have an opening for the earpiece and the immediate camera, not the reverse camera. It would be helpful to have known this BEFORE purchase.Oct. 2013....So far the screen saver has worked great.
0.9946572	0.8198376	This &#34;Tech Armor&#34; company REALLY cares about your satisfaction.  I ordered this high def version and was very disappointed as it was very difficult to keep clean ... Greasy and fingerprints etc.  my complaint was immediately addressed and they sent me the anti-glare protectors ASAP .  Wow!!!  The anti glare protectors are just what I wanted...with no noticeable sacrifice in definition.  The incredible thing to note is this company's commitment to customer satisfaction.  Tech Armor is a company you can trust.
0.55286926	0.59606683	The quality of the product is excellent.  No bubbles at all and you have to look closely to even see there is a screen protector on the phone.  However, it was my first experience installing a screen protector and I inadvertently ruined the first one before I figured it out.  It would have been helpful to have written instructions with the product.
0.99809164	0.7618486999999999	It's a super great product. It's so smooth,clear and no bubble. I love it. It's so perfect screen protector for Iphone5. I would recomended to everyone should buy this Tech Armor screen protector for the Iphone5. Thanks,
0.98714113	0.72642213	Item arrived as described and in good condition. Works great, and they have an online video that shows you how to put the screen on, which was very helpful.
0.8624412	0.68109715	Very useful in crowds, or in front of family , and showing only what they need to see, when browsing pics.
0.9345360999999999	0.79044926	This Tech Armor privacy screen for my iphone 5 was exactly as described. It shipped fast, and contains a lifetime warranty which is a plus. It does have some black lines that you can see on the screen because of the privacy screen, but if you want a privacy screen, that's just something you have to deal with.
0.69333804	0.52000064	I like this screen protector because its smooth. I had a little trouble putting it on buy I got it on, I don't even know if I put it on right! Ahhaha
0.9921271999999999	0.78447163	Product was on time and as described. Easy to apply and comes with everything you need. Can't even tell it's on the phone
0.9256376000000001	0.828691	I have tried dozens of brands and types of screen protectors on my iPhone5. Whether they are &#34;break-proof' glass or plastic, they all reflect highly, glare in the bright sun and show every small touch mark. All,, that is, except for these &#34;Matte&#34; screen protectors from Tech Armor. They wear well, are easy to wipe clean, do not glare nor gather smudge marks from finger touches easily. Why more companies are not onto making these, I do not know - But, I DO know that this  product is better than others I have tried and is inexpensive! What else might we ask for?
0.9598068999999999	0.7741642	One of the clearest and most protective iPhone covers I have ever seen.  Putting it on can be tricky but well worth it once it's on.  Has stood up to a good amount of wear and tear in the two weeks I've had it.
0.240421	0.5011012	the numbers on the tabs of each screen are hard to see--so I lost the first two.  Also--they need an extra hole near the speaker.  iPhone 5 has a &#34;noise cancelling&#34; hole that is now covered by the shield
0.9900334999999999	0.83121455	Screen protector is cut accurately for the iPhone 5. Fit is excellent for me, fits inside of the interior case dimensions for my Specks case. Only had to use 1, normally I have to use more to get 1 applied. So far this is a great product.
0.9995487	0.9012023000000001	This screen protector was for my new iphone 5. This is probably my tenth smart phone and my twentieth screen protector to install. This Tech Armor HD screen protector is by far the best I have seen yet. It was very easy to install with easy directions and even a how to video on their web site. I can not even tell that it is on the phone as far as picture clarity or touch screen sensitivity goes. I highly recommend this screen protector to anyone considering one.
0.86799514	0.7492813	The screen protector worked great in sun light and rainbow effect when wearing my sunglasses. Also really adheres to the screen! So far so good.
0.99931383	0.79455006	This was the first product I bought on Amazon and it exceeded my expectations. Its super easy to install and comes with two backup screen protectors. I highly recommended this screen protector. Besides the price can't be beat!
0.6114649000000001	0.60526425	I really didn't believe that this screen protector would keep greasy fingerprints and smudges off the screen. Well it does. Some anti-glare screens I've used in the past have made the screen too dim, but with Tech Armor screen I do not see much difference in brightness compared with no screen protector.
0.78170407	0.6263207	I used to have one that give a better cushioning, but it was too easy to dent. This Tech Armor comes with 3 screen protectors. I guess if you screwed up applying one, you have 2 more for backup. Not sure how well it will withstand sketches yet, but the using my finger nail doesn't seem to do anything. The best thing about this one is that it looks very clear.
0.97427404	0.79751325	This screen protector does all that it promises.  I've had it on my new iPhone5 for a couple of weeks now - no glare and no shiny fingerprints.  Thanks to the installation guidance in the purchase confirmation email I received from Tech Armor, I had no problems applying the screen protector.  So I still have 2 protectors left for later use. Happy!!
0.9915096	0.87458444	"I've been through quite a few screen protectors from different suppliers, for different devices.  I've always had issues with the application, either the fitment was off, or the material wasn't conducive to a no-bubble install. I read that to resolve the latter, a wet style protector was best, so the previous protector was a Skinomi product that installs using a wet solution, and it's pretty decent, though neither of our devices got a super clear final result, plus I always had a touch of concern using fluids around our phones.Well, recently while wiping down my wife's phone, I accidentally peeled up the Skinomi from the bottom, it got fouled up so a reapplication wasn't an option.  I decided to try some dry protectors this time, and order this product as well as some Spigen Ultra Crystal.  I haven't tried the Spigen yet, but the Tech Armor are excellent.  The application (the real issue with most of these products) is simple, and easy to to achieve a bubble-free, lint-free result.  I used the supplied cleaning cloth, the ""dust tape"", lined up the bottom, and it was about 5 minutes for a near perfect install.  The protector itself is incredibly clear, the cutouts are very accurate, and the surface ""feel"" is close to the tactile feel of the OEM glass.Assuming it winds up being reasonably durable, it's a solid 4 stars, and I'd consider revising to a 5 star if it holds up well.  These are also a very good value at about $7 for 3 protectors."
0.31287529999999997	0.29524368	Took only minutes to install. No bubbles or problems. I watched the how to video first and followed their directions.
0.99662554	0.82009685	Great item easy install great pricing does what it says it will! This screen protector much better than 3ms version at a fraction of the cost!
0.9956292	0.83637524	This protector fits the iPhone 5 perfectly and you can hardly even tell it's on there! Would absolutely buy again!
0.9941460999999999	0.7387048	follow the instructions and you'll have two extra screen protectors for &#34;Keepsakes&#34;. Great online video addresses any questions you might have to perfect a clean installation.
0.9885189	0.7291316999999999	I LOVE THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR. IT IS ANTI-GLARE AND DOESN'T HURT YOUR EYES. MAKES THINGS LOOK NICE AND SLEEK. EASY TO PUT ON!!
0.99262035	0.80706733	This is by far the best screen protector that I've ever applied. I have used in the past more than 30 protectors for other phones. but I always end up with bubbles. This time. I did not have a single bubble left inside. The price is very good and the quality is the same as the $30 one they sell at apple store. I highly recommend it.
0.9096216	0.7274930000000001	you can not even tell that its on there, they give you everything you need to lay it on, the dust tape worked really, 5 stars for price and quality!!
0.9288379999999999	0.8043288000000001	Really great product. It goes on easily and doesn't show fingerprints. Has a slight texture but you get use to that quickly.
0.8251046000000001	0.7453217	It works as advertised. It went on clean and no bubbles. Usually when I buy super cheap screen protectors there not scratch resistant, but this product is! I've had this product on my phone since I bought my 32gb iPhone 5 and it's as perfect as it was when I first put it on. Fingerprints are still an issue but that's totally fine nothing a micro fiber cloth can't get rid of.
0.99614674	0.75713044	great protector and feels nice to slide and best of all its cheap...i recommend to anyone with an iphone 5
0.9548693000000001	0.74419904	I received my screen protectors and after opening them I was very impressed.  On the downside it took me all 3 to get one on in place.  The iPhones retina display is barely changed at all there is a little bit of fuzzy look but it isn't ver noticeable unless you strain your eyes to look.  All in all great screen protectors and great customer service as well 5 stars!
0.9981189	0.8684325	Love this protector. It installed so easy, no bubbles and looks great. I've tries several others and none of them compare. Buy it.
0.83767486	0.610633	I bought this for my IPad too.  It protect from scratches etc.  So if you get scratches this is a very good product for you and your screen.
0.96812975	0.7861725	Completely invisible, doesn't feel like having an additional layer on top of the screen. Got it right the first time! The video tutorial on the techarmor site helps. :)
0.9936493000000001	0.801178	I loved the quality of this product and the materials included made it a breeze to apply. Tech Armor will get more business from me in the future.
0.99560356	0.8493940999999999	I've tried many brands, and this is by far the best in terms of durability, no fingerprints etc, and 360 privacy.
0.9459163	0.7280977	I personally like the anti-glare matte covers. This is a pack of three; affordable and exactly as described, but be careful not to scratch the top as you are applying. It isn't scratch proof.
0.99508286	0.7653649	"This is by far the best screen protector I've ever had. It works just as advertised. I've had it for about a week (Because it was delivered early) and I haven't had a fingerprint, smudge, or a speck of grease to speak of. In fact, I'm writing this review right now because I just looked up and thought to myself, ""Goodness, I love this screen protector."" Good job Tech Armor. I highly recommend this product."
0.99524486	0.7879231	This screen protecter is great. It keeps leering eyes away. Great price, great seller, great item, great quality. Will order more, even though there is a lifetime warranty.
0.9906322	0.8190545	Excellent product. Very easy to put on the screen. I even forget that it is on the screen sometimes, it's that clear. No glare.
0.9899726000000001	0.8147368	Very easy to install. Very few bubbles. I would recommend these to anyone. Nice out in the sunlight. If you ae outdoors a lot this is a must.
0.9922122999999999	0.6298077	Best antiglare ive found no complaints whatsoever I have many many many many many many words left to meet the minimum word requirement
0.83700204	0.683612	I bought this privacy protector about a year ago and it works great. My iphone had some trouble with auto-brightness, I took it to Verizon and they said that it was the screen protector that was the cause, I knew it wasn't but they said to remove it and I did, it ended up being the phone and I got a new iphone but my privacy protector didn't look as good when I tried to put it back on, I contacted the seller and explained what happen, they sent me a new one AND I RECIEVED IT THE NEXT DAY!! FOR FREE!!! by far the best service i've ever had. I'm sticking with Tech Armor forever!!! :)
0.9851949000000001	0.7073811	This brand has the best customer service ever. My cover came a little damaged, I contacted the company and they sent a replacement right away. Will recommend it to anyone.
0.9754541999999999	0.7123295000000001	Good product. The item was shipped promptly and easy to install.  The phone looks like it doesn't have it on which I love because it doesn't take shine from the screen
0.7064223000000001	0.7515446	The three screen protectors one receives from placing this order will in fact protect your iPhone 5. The protectors have two adhesive stickers which allow you to line up the protector properly before permanently applying. I'm sure there are other, more expensive protectors out there that are stronger, but I've also found the stronger protectors create more of a cloudy effect that tends to occur with a thicker screen protector. For the money, this is the protecter to go with, the phone image is still crystal clear. Friendship.
0.99232244	0.7804807	I just recently installed this protector on my phone so I didn't have a chance to see how it stands up against scratches and other abuse,  but the installation was amazing.  Everything you need is included(cloth, card, and tape) to a very nice dust and spec free install, my covers usually pickup a spec of dust from somewhere even after cleaning over and over, this time none. Really good kit!
0.9992628	0.8930659	My first screen protector and so far it's been very solid.Very easy to apply and it fits well with my case without any bunching or bubbling on the edges, which is a complaint I've read about with other protectors.It still does pick up fingerprints occasionally and it does distort the clarity of the screen ever so slightly, but for the price, it seems to be a great deal so far. Highly recommended.
0.99011004	0.71911764	worth the investment, easy to put on,not to mention it comes with few extra products. easy to use and smooth
0.9860405000000001	0.73362553	Simple like that: cheap, good and easy to apply. I totally recomend it! No air bubbles and protects a lot!
0.9641859	0.6991399	Cheap and very good product. I already had other models from different brands, but this one is the best I my opiniom.
0.93906915	0.82055104	The screen protector has a high quality fit and was fairly easy to apply.  It has protective film on both sides that you peel off when applying.  It also comes with a sticky tape that is very helpful to remove dust particals which cause bubbles.  I was able to remove several bubbles for a completely bubble free finish.
0.9941076999999999	0.7925266	It comes with a cloth, a piece of cardboard to apply and the best thing... a small adhesive tape to get rid of the dust and little particles on your screen that will help you to apply it and feel like you did a great job. Love it.
0.8732101999999999	0.46289355	Complete install kit with instructions.  Recommend!Nothing else to say to get to fourteen words.  Not a very wordy person.  If they want a rating they should allow a short concise review.  So: Five stars for the product, 1/2 star for the review process.  There I guess I finally achieved fourteen words. Have a nice day, it is a nice day here only a slight chance of rain today.  Wishing a very fine day to everyone.  Tech Armor  Protector works great.
0.7997196	0.73136306	Overall, simple screen protector. Leaves a lot of finger prints but gets the job done. The clarity of the screen is good.Would recommend.
0.9893468000000001	0.7923800999999999	The screen protector is one of the best. Tech Armor has the best protectors for the ipad and iphone. I currently use the iphone one and it has sustained many scratches and still looks great. The anti-glare is a BIG ++++
0.99821246	0.8263224	These are much cheaper than you can buy at the cell phone store and are just as high quality.  Highly recommend.
0.9574648000000001	0.72212994	Had this screen protector on my iPhone for months still lasting really well. Very happy with this product. I did mess up the first time but 3 came in the pack and I was not worried about it.
0.95122075	0.60495985	makes it easier to use the iphone outdoors thanks to anti-glare. makes iphone look better thanks to anti-fingerprints. I like the feel of it.
0.9542406999999999	0.80006945	Not sure why they say these are HD.  Maybe because they don't interfere with the retina display.  I do like these screen protectors.  Keeps the screen scratch free and helps maintain the &#34;retina display experience.&#34; I would have a touch screen phone without a Tech Armor screen protector.
0.9982790000000001	0.8352835	My teenagers put these on there iPhones and they love them!  Much clearer than the old ones & very easy to install.
0.9827869	0.72208506	When you have a teen daughter who drops her phone fifty times a day, this is exactly what you need for extra insurance!!!
0.9993418	0.90282875	This is by far the easiest screen protector I've ever installed on any phone.  It works as advertised and you can't beat the value.I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a matte screen protector that does not retain fingerprints or smudges.
0.44906834	0.55043066	The cover is a matte anti-glare protective cover, but it scratches too easily and it bothers me because I can't get rid of them and that's all I notice whenever I look at my iPhone.
0.99923575	0.85981846	Works great.  It keeps screen protected and clean, even when my 6 yr old gransons plays games on my phone.Highly recommend it.
0.61817586	0.67738694	this screen protector works great. installation was quick, but you have to be careful what case you choose to use because cases tend to raise the corners of this protector which ultimately had to take it off. but it was nice while it lasted. i would recommend this to some one who case a soft case that doesn't touch the edges of screen or no case at all, maybe a bumper?
0.04800737	0.32839662	Just got these today, my husband put his on and it was all scratched up by the time he finished. He did mine, managed to get it on scratch free but after using my phone a couple times my finger nail put scratches all over it from just swiping the screen! Not like i have dagger nails! After my first call my earring scratched it bad. HORRIBLE! Haven't even had a chance to put it in a pocket or my purse, our screens will look like garbage at this rate. No wonder they come in a 3 pack! Thought w/ such a high rating it would be better.
0.9692348	0.68453825	The product is tricky to apply but with patience it works great.  I can not tell it is on the phone's screen.  It appears to be a quality product.  When I need more this will be my choice.
0.9578804	0.6620007	Easy to install but it would be great if any of these guys would send you a small squeegee to help install perfectly.
0.9390223	0.78196776	does what it says it will do - and comes with multiple protectors. almost unnoticeable screen distortion. hands down one of the best screen protectors i have had.
0.9383140999999999	0.80601954	Extremely easy to put on, takes 30 seconds.Can't beat 3 protectors for $6.Don't let the cell phone carrier stores rip you off.
0.8518684999999999	0.6357010999999999	I bought these HD clear screens and it's hard to tell that there is a screen protecting my phone from getting scratched.
0.36574435	0.47913325	Does not provide blocking. It makes things a little blurry from certain angles, but thats it, you can still see what I am doing on the phone
0.9928454	0.8447305	Product is as described, completely cuts glare and provides great smudge resistance. The film is pretty thick so it's much easier to put on than those regular screen protectors (whose purposes I'm not entirely sure of). I got the 2nd one on perfectly, accidentally misaligned the first.I recommend making a &#34;somewhat sterile&#34; environment in the bathroom by running a hot shower for a couple minutes, then peeling off the entire back and lining up the camera/speakerhole first. You get 3 in a pack so don't worry if the first one isn't perfect.
0.011600256000000001	0.50853705	I'm accustomed to going to the mall and paying $12 for a screen protector and putting it on my phone myself. I saw that this was $6 for 3 shields and figured it was worth the gamble. It wasn't. Very cheap material with even worse adhesive. No matter what, I couldn't get it perfect. There were either bubbles in the shield and/or the edges would stick all the way. I contacted the manufacturer and they were not easy to work with at all. I returned the item to amazon.Pros:The priceCons:The product is extremely inferior to other shields in every way besides price. Spend a little more and get a better shield.
0.99829227	0.8319886999999999	Very easy to install, great protection and I can barely tell the phone has anything on top. Great value for my money.
0.44416764	0.5533631999999999	Easy smooth installation... I would give it a 5 star if it did not excessively collect finger prints and oils and made the screen look smudged and dirty.
0.00049716234	0.46131727	Very dissapointed in this product. I went by the reviews of this product. Installation went fine for me. The worst part is that it kills the quality of your screen. I switched from a skinomi screen protector and wish I didn't. I have to get another skinomi on my phone asap. Waste of time... Waste of money...
0.99961215	0.8258544	This was such a good product!! It was exactly as described and I love the feel and matte finish plus the price is just excellent, would highly recommend:)
0.6643102	0.49566713	this is a good item it was worth buying. i liked it, and if i hat to buy another screen protector then i would choose this one
0.98817915	0.79316044	Not sure why these are different but they are. This is a nice screen protector that is a little bit thicker than those you might buy off of ebay. Great instructions, quick shipping, and a good price. Went on perfect and NO BUBBLES. I will only buy Tech Armor from now on.
0.9868889000000001	0.64795184	I chose this rating because it fulfilled the required specifications to my phone.  I liked everything about this product.  I recommend this product to anyone who owns an iPhone 5.
0.8767521	0.7862598000000001	This is the first screen protector that, when I went to apply it, I got absolutely no bubbles! It went on perfectly the first time and looks great. I noticed another review that said something about there not being a whole circle around the Home button but this protector has a full circle. The phone responds perfect to my touch and it's like the protector isn't even there.
0.9903420000000001	0.7774854	Easy to apply without air bubbles and was MUCH cheaper/more effective than the products I bought the larger chain stores.
0.9770988000000002	0.6173194000000001	I recently bought my 3rd iPhone, the iPhone 5. Applying film protectors drive me bananas. I'm not good at it and it stresses me out. I ordered the Tech Armor films from Amazon based on the customer ratings it received. When they arrived I set aside some time, sat down with my new films, and tried to relax. Wow, what a shock. I followed the directions, and had the film on in aminute with one bubble which I easily squeezed out. Miracle? Or great product? Let's just say, I've bought numerous film covers over the years and I will never, ever again buy anything other than Tech Armor.
0.9996103000000001	0.7556828	Excellent value.  Easy to install. Would highly recommend to anyone with a new iphone 5.  Tell all of your friends
0.9666195	0.756894	As with all of the screen protectors, you need to use care and preparation. I found this to be a fine product. My finger glides smoothly over the surface.
0.7604668000000001	0.6225273	There was one problem installing following the your directions.  That method did not line up the camera in the small hole provided on the screen.  I found it worked better after first peeling back the layer slightly, first lining up the camera first then sticking the bottom and peeling back the protective layer.  So we waisted two screens first.
0.9853972	0.77876544	"I enjoy using Tech Armour screen protectors. Besides the mini micro fiber cloth, there is a ""sticker"" for removing dust, which helps a great deal when spacing the screen protector on to make sure no bubbles and no dust is trap under the film."
0.99145615	0.90078485	This privacy screen truly does provide 360 degrees of privacy. I get surprised comments from potential on-lookers all the time (i.e. &#34;Whoa, why can't I see your screen??&#34;), and in my line of work, confidentiality is a must. Be aware, you may need to increase the brightness on your phone for your personal visibility, which can drain your battery. This is true for all privacy screens, though the Tech Armor ones are better than others when it comes to aesthetics (no cross-hatched look).It is easy to put on, and any little bubbles that creep in can be pressed out easily. Fit perfectly onto my new iPhone 5.Not to mention, lifetime guarantee! How can you beat that?
0.9442351999999999	0.61782265	I am pleased so far, it is hard to get the screens on w/o a little  bubble or 2. but no big deal for me. It's doing the job
0.99747753	0.81350315	This is a wonderful product.  I have had it for almost a month, and it has met above and beyond expectations.  I'm glad I got it. No complaints!
0.9928613000000002	0.81143826	These are great, highly recommended! I hate the smudges that you usually get on your screen and this completely prevents them.
0.9902158999999999	0.8335341000000001	I couldn't believe how nice this is case was when I first put it on my phone. The quality is incredible. It has a matte-like look to it, and is super easy to install. Do your best to get all of the dust off first though, because I accidentally ruined one of the cases just trying to pull it off again after the install to get some remaining dust off the screen. This is probably the best shield I've ever had on a phone, iPod, etc. and it was only six bucks! I highly recommend it!
0.17505839999999998	0.5152836	The privacy screen itself is great. I had a problem actually getting it on my screen and it being line up with my camera. Also did not get all of the bubbles out, and it is already tearing up around my home button.
0.10780981	0.48800284	I have purchased this screen protector back in October when I first got my iPhone. I reordered another pack just in case for future use. After opening up the pack, I saw that the screen protector isn't the same anymore. The cutoff are off. The cutouts for the camera and speaker should to fit perfectly. Now it's just two long strip cutouts for the camera and speaker. It also doesn't line up properly. There is excess to the left of the camera and speaker. I'm very disappointed in this. I'll probably shop around for screen protectors now. I have one left of the original ones I purchased so hopefully I won't ruin my current screen protector anytime soon.
0.48532864	0.59912455	The screen protectors are nice but only last a few months and then are all scratched up and get holes/cuts in the top layer of the protector. If you buy some buy a few packs. But they do a good job as stated in the description and my phone screen has no scratches.
0.03951186	0.55752504	After reading all the wonderful reviews for this product, I was greatly disappointed. First, they are not easy to put on. Little bubbles are bound to pop up and that magical stupid squeegee thing does not help much if at all for the little bubbles. But my biggest complaint are those stupid little labels that are supposed to just peel right off. They don't they leave this horrible goop on the top of the screen that doesn't come off! These screen protectors are a giant waste of money, time and effort. Thankfully they didn't cost much money.
0.9950079	0.7937593000000001	I am thrilled with my tech armor screen protector. Goes on super easy with no bubbles. You honestly cannot tell its even on your screen once it's on correctly. I love it!
0.6623063	0.6185495	I bought this once before and I liked it but I couldn't handle how dark and fuzzy it made the screen. It definitely was privacy proof though because sometimes I couldn't even see my phone! I like this alot, so I bought it again and figured it does what it says and I don't mind the fuzziness. But it does kind of diminish screen quality if you have your brightness on a battery saving level. If you turn it all the way up, it's fine.
0.8940834000000001	0.45398164	I really am impressed with the Tech Armor HD iPhone 5 screen protector. It doesn't look or feel like I have a s.p. on my phone which is what I wanted.
0.99932677	0.8584009	The screen protectors are great quality and exactly what are described when purchasing! I am really enjoying the matte finish and  I would definitely recommend getting these.
0.9783248	0.67973363	This was easy to install and so far is working great. Plus it comes with three in case you screw up, one gets gross, or your friend needs one (like in my case).
0.8408953000000001	0.6928512	I didn't realize it contains 3 packs. It's easy to stick to the screen and feels really comfortable with its low price.
0.89446783	0.78389025	Very easy to apply, I got it on with the first try and didn't need the extra 2. Only one teeny air bubble that I probably could have gotten out if I tried but it doesn't bother me. I love the feeling it's like there's nothing there at all. Beware that once you first put it on it feels sticky and hard to swipe smoothly but it only took a couple hours to feel smooth. I prefer the regular finish instead of matte because its just as easy to glide your fingers on and doesn't show graininess. The glare isn't even noticeable to me, if there even is a glare. The cutouts line up nicely as we'll.
0.8770859000000001	0.8137684000000001	I've tried many different screen protectors and these were very simple to install.  I didn't get any bubbles, and that was on the first try.  The clear is actually very clear.  Not a matte finish that can hamper the definition of the screen.  I would definitely purchase these again.
0.9994325000000001	0.8110954	I love this screen protector. Protects my screen well, was reasonably easy to apply, and does an awesome job in the sun.
0.9273114	0.74980915	This screen is great. After watching the YouTube video of how to put the screen on I was able to apply it right the first time with no bubbles. After about 2 weeks of use the corners haven't come up at all, it has great durability. Since its a matte protector the screen is now a little grainy but not an issue. I think this is a great value for what you pay, and you get 3!
0.79468393	0.7466185000000001	"I am one of the customers who had problems with my protectors.  I did watch Tech Armor's instruction video prior to putting on the protectors.  The first one had bubbles in it that I could not get out.  The second one would not stay ""stuck"" to the screen; it would move around slightly during use.  The third one finally worked.  So, why the 5 star rating? ... Because, Tech Armor's customer service department is great.  When I contacted them with the issues I had, not only did they give me some great additional tips on getting the protectors to work properly, they sent me three replacement protectors for free!  Wow, a company that truly stands behind its product and listens to the customers' concerns!"
0.93358654	0.64920557	It was easy to install after watching the video. I had no bubbles in the screen protector. I would recommend this to a friend.
0.9971478000000001	0.69130987	customer service was excellent.I will be recommend this product to my friends,protector gives full clarity for my iPhone 5 screen
0.9946736999999999	0.8281146999999999	I had no problems what so ever with this product, installation was easy and the screen protector isn't noticeable. Well worth the money!
0.9978163000000001	0.8595811	I have owned a lot of screen protectors, and this by far is the best screen protector i have owned. You can barely tell that my iPhone 5 has anything on it! Love it , super easy to put on and the cut was great. I've had some that are so precise on the edges that no matter how good you put it on it will get caught on a case and bubble up. This one is just right, i put it on and immediately put on a very tight case with no issues.
0.96920365	0.6244039	Installation/application was smooth because I watched the tutorial video. It comes with 3 films and happily I got it right the first time.  I feel so much better since applying this screen shield to protect my new iPhone.
0.99828255	0.8158715999999999	easy to install and fit perfect on the i phone 5.the price was great cheaper than at the store where I got phone
0.32959017	0.6109884	This product is not nearly as effective as a former screen protector product I used for my iPhone 4.  The size is correct for the iPhone 5 though the dye-cut holes for camera and speaker are a bit off center.  The biggest objection is the inevitable dust trap and air bubble yield during application.  I have gone through 3 shield applications while exercising extreme caution with each attempt but continue to acquire multiple imperfections.  I would recommend experimenting with alternate products with a thinner substrate.
0.38522756	0.40252158	I was unhappy with the results, after third time contacted support they sent additional screen protectors. Great support. Watch the install video.Thanks
0.91247386	0.7418051	Price was right and arrived as promised. However, I had difficulty applying the screen protectors on my phone. I used all three of them and I still have bubbles. I have applied these before on other phones and tablets. One of the protectors didn't have any adhedise.
0.99532354	0.78638405	These are by far the best screen protectors i have found. Easy to put on, and the best feel of all that I have tried.
0.035986632000000005	0.39902714	I purchased this product because it had many positive reviews. When I received my iPhone, I put the cover on it. I ended up go through all three in the package because I thought put on wrong the first time because the left corner of the protector wouldn't stick down.  I thought another would work better but the other two did the same exact thing. The remainder of the screen was perfect expect for the bottom left corner.
0.99798447	0.77715385	Wonderful, amazing product. I wouldn't buy anything else now that I've tried this. Very easy to apply and is very clear once it's on. Love it :)
0.98275423	0.7040082	It was easy to apply to my phone and I hardly notice that it is there. It offers awesome protection.
0.79422534	0.5998529	My second skinomi.  The best way to protect a screen, by far.  The first Skinomi I bought, about 5 years ago, I am still using.  The other protectors they sell you work for a while, then wear out.  That's why they sell them in packs of three.  Skinomi's last longer than the machine.  Take your time, read the instructions, follow them, plan an hour off to apply the skin.  Then you're done.  Until you buy a new machine.  Can't say enough good about whatever they are made out of.I will say that the piece for the back of the phone did not fit.  But I don't need a piece for the back, I have a case for that.And mine didn't come with enough of their special 'solution' you are supposed to spray on.  I used water instead.  It worked fine.  I have a feeling that's what the 'special' solution is anyway.
0.20848384	0.62102664	Doesn't really last long if you use your phone as much as I do. Mine was peeling off after a couple of days.
0.9867168	0.78989196	Product was shipped fast and was as advertised. Easy installation, happy with the product. I have only had it on for a few days and there are a few scratches on the screen protector.
0.99787104	0.81859386	Great product for a great price.  Went on easily and have an extra just incase.  I would recommend this product to others.
0.980093	0.7368621999999999	I bought iphone 4s HD and iphone 5s HD.  They are amazing.  You don't feel that you add an other layer on the screen.  It  just like the original screen when you touch it.  Recommand! Recomand!
0.9790540999999999	0.7822755	Very good product, keeps your screen safe from scratches...Fits the screen very good as opposed to other protectors that I used in the past.
0.9103415000000001	0.78940034	Screen protector goes on easily - got it lined up and without air bubbles first try. Just make sure the screen is completely clean before you put the protector on. Barely notice it once it's on. A great value too, considering what I've paid for screen protectors in the past.
0.9991391	0.8921013000000001	This was by far the easiest screen protector I have ever used. Not one bubble or dust particle. Fit perfectly. Rated it 4 stars because the cover doesn't cover the area under the home button. I fear that this area is not protected enough and will get scratched. The HD screen protector is great no lose of HD clarity. Suggest they make the cover that protects the area under the home button. Thanks EricTech Armor Screen ProtectorUpdate as of 1 Dec 2012Company has developed an updated version of screen protector for iPhone 5 this update addresses my concerns addressed on original review. 5 stars all the way I recommend to all. I also purchased the Tech Armor screen protector for new iPad 4 w/ retina display. It went on perfect no bubbles or lint, perfect fit again.  Customer service impeccable. Thank you Tech Armory for making a quality product worth writing a review on.Thanks Eric
0.9172968	0.74253213	Little time consuming to get on, but lasts a long time.When you put it on, you're bound to get some dust or fingerprints in-between causing bubbles. Get two pieces of scotch tape, use one to peel up the protector, and the other to grab little pieces of dust, works great!
0.3779037	0.7415108	This screen protector went on easily and has remained on for well over six months now. I like this one because it is not shiny, and when standing in the sun looking at me screen, it does not create a glare, and I can still see the screen.
0.16985053	0.53146213	I selected this protector based on the star rating many had given it, however when I received it I realized that the holes cut for the camera and speaker are a little over a quarter inch too wide to the left. This is unfortunate because not only does it look odd, but it allows dirt to get in this area. I've sent in a request on their website to see if they have correctly cut ones. If they are able to remedy the situation, I'll probably update this to let people know.
0.99539745	0.84580845	I tried three screen protectors and the Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector was the easiest to apply and also had the most coverage.  Solid product.
0.99442244	0.8505256	This product works exactly as it states in the description....  perfectly.  Easy to apply, and doesn't obscure the image on the iphone.
0.9828539000000001	0.77048516	Great screen protector, easy to put on your phone, supper clear, I have no problem with a glare. Of course the I Phone 5 is an awsome phone.
0.8726896999999999	0.6946523	I like that it's a screen and a flimsy plastic sticker.  Much better protection! And I was able to give my Mom on and still have an extra one for myself!
0.9989929	0.86011565	Great screen protectors! All the holes are cut out and it fits perfectly. It even comes with an installation kit that is really easy to use. Perfect HD, crystal clear view of the screen. It's like there is no screen protector on at all! I will be ordering this product again when I need more!
0.86159825	0.6466849	They don't scratch, and are anti glare, I like the finish, would by them again, worth the money, shipped fast.
0.9892732	0.8155888000000001	Since I've had iPhones a screen protector was part of them. I've bought all different kinds and paid $25 for a single screen protector from Zagg invisashield. Without a doubt this is by far the best screen protector my iphone has ever had. I've had for a week. Quality is superior, installation very easy, durability cant say yet but heck they bring three. Give these screen shots a chance. I guarantee enjoy the they look and feel.
0.97636056	0.7782078	Great case and holster it is very durable and will last a long time , I bought one from Verizon that looked exactly the same design and everything that costs me 45 $.  I will stick with this,one !
0.9956709	0.8959773000000001	I originally purchased the Tech Armor Anti-Glare / Anti-Fingerprint screen protectors but decided shortly thereafter that the iPhone 5 screen is just too marvelous to hide. The Anti-Glare ones do detract from the retina display but that was to be expected. Anyhow, I really liked what Tech Armor has to offer so I gave these HD Clear ones a try and it's amazing! It's true what others are saying in that you can't even notice it's there and it doesn't take away from the quality of the screen at all. One of my biggest concerns on clear screen protectors was whether or not fingerprints are noticeable - well on these all I can say so far is I've been using my phone for a few minutes and while there are minor finger prints, they are only noticeable with the screen OFF. And that's all I really care about. Plus, giving it a quick wipe with your shirt takes care of the fingerprints so the trade off to have a beautiful screen is worth it.
0.7885696999999999	0.6919736999999999	Exactly what you expect. As other reviews note putting it onto the phone is the key - wipe your phone down to avoid bubbles or little specks of dust.I don't even notice that it's there (though I added it immediately when I got the phone so I don't know any different but it does not seem to alter the touch).
0.28210512	0.6600433000000001	Pretty easy to apply, but there's still glare. I only bought this one instead of the clear because I wanted to cut down on glare so that's disappointing. I'm not that into anything HD and I notice the loss of clarity. Wish I had ordered the other one!
0.990734	0.82613397	By far one of the easiest applications of a screen protector.  Liked that the openings were cut perfectly for both the white and black iPhone 5s.  Protectors are also case friendly.
0.901442	0.7246136999999999	They are great! Although I messed up the first time, luckily the was two more screens to work with. They are inexpensive as well.
0.9212681999999999	0.8066683000000001	I email requested a replacement screen and they provided hassle free! I am a very satisfied customer, thank you Tech Armor!Dust is your worst enemy, wash your hands and apply in a steamy room. One spec of dust will ruin your application, so wipe that screen clean and apply quickly. My buddy works as a screen protector tech at Best Buy and his method of slightly bending the protector hot-dog style and lining up both the camera and home button simultaneously works best in my opinion.I switched to tech armor from skinomi, their screen protectors have this gel like malleable material that leaves bumps when your finger nails indent the protector. I couldn't see any of that happening with this screen protector so I'm happy about that. The matte finish does seem to make images less sharp however I knew this and I willing to sacrifice some image sharpness for less visible finger print smudges.
0.9937087	0.72818184	It was a great product for the price and it brought 3 protectors with a nice feel and easy application to them. I recommend it thoroughly.
0.42449868	0.4523013	I really like this screen protector.  Visually, it's hard to tell that anything is even on my phone.  I also like that it doesn't require a wet/solution to put the protector on.  And, it comes with three in a pack!
0.39214662	0.5362566	I had problems with the dust making it into the application of these to my new iphone, and as the enclosure from the company requested, contact their customer support. They got back to me right away and sent me out a new pack. The product itself is worth the repeat business, but their customer support and quick response won me over. From now on, it's tech armor and only tech armor for all my gear.
0.9714587	0.7947185	good thicker quality, still with easy touch. not a pro at electronic stuff.  it serves the purpose well.  would recommend to anyone looking for screen protection.
0.819049	0.70743567	I did not realize I was getting a matte finish, nor would I have had an opinion if I had.  I could not separate the protector from the cover sheet, but my daughter did it for me.  The matte stays clean and works really well for finger swipes. All screen protectors are expensive, and these are fairly typically priced.
0.97817767	0.7422753000000001	It came so fast & works perfectly I would've had so many scratches on my screen if it wasn't for this
0.23868963	0.45572382	easy to apply, not a speck of dust, and no air bubbles, so clear it's difficult to see it's even there
0.8930099	0.6510792	Solid product, simple instructions, easy installation. Came with three screen protectors for less than the cost of the one subpar screen protector I purchased from and returned to my neighborhood big box.
0.7808026	0.6238515	The first time I tried using the Tech Armor Screen Protectors on my iPhone 5 things did not go so well. In quick succession the three protectors were rendered useless. I called to complain. Happily someone got right back to me. He reassured me that Tech Armor stands behind their product and also that the instructions on installation could be a bit confusing. They sent me a link to a you tube video on installation, plus mailed replacement protectors, to the address I was leaving for (in Canada). The replacements arrived. This time everything worked really well and I have a well protected iPhone.Tech Armor iPhone 5 Premium High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector [3-Pack] - Retail Packaging
0.72244084	0.72686124	Fits fine; the holes for the camera and speakers don't quite align perfectly, but they give you enough space that it won't cover anything. I like the matte look, but it makes the images on the screen a bit more blurry from up close.
0.7758649000000001	0.7071864999999999	I have straggled with other screen protectors in the past, and maybe because of the past practice, I got better with applying it on the screen.  Or maybe this was a better product.  I am not sure which, but this one got onto my iphone quite easily, and it doesn't affect the screen quality.  I hardly remember it is on my phone.  It has been 2 months since I used this product, and it hasn't gotten a scratch on it.  It's a nice product.If you aren't used to it, it's a fight against air bubbles... my recommendation is to get multi-pack (it's cheap anyway) and use the first one as a practice.  it saves a lot of frustration.
0.9895792999999999	0.86708915	By far the easiest screen protector i have ever used! Screen went on without any bubbles with minimal effort- was so easy to put on, i didn't even need to use the included card to remove air bubbles. The protective screen actually makes the images on the phone appear sharper! Great product and would buy Tech Armor again and again!
0.9963790000000001	0.7374480999999999	The best screen protectors I've bought. They supply tools that make them easy to apply, and the protectors themselves are high quality. I'll definitely buy again.Thank you very much!
0.9800334999999999	0.8310429	These screen protectors are of really good quality. There's almost no glare whatsoever and they are very easy to install. Just make sure you clean the screen with the cloth to make sure you don't get air bubbles!
0.97879994	0.84291327	Applied this to my iPhone 5. It feels smooth as glass, as if there were no cover at all. I've applied lots of protectors by different manufacturer. The trick I read about, is scotch tape.My iPhone screen was not pristinely clean to start with. I wiped the screen with a little water on a microfiber. Then dried it with a dry microfiber. I used regular scotch tape to lift remaining dust particles off the glass screen. I then followed directions on the screen protector and applied it to the screen.Using the hard plastic tool included, I pushed small bubbles toward the edge. To eliminate stray dust specks, I put scotch tape on the top to lift the screen protector off the glass. Then lightly touched another piece of scotch tape to either the screen or the screen protector (wherever the dust speck was). A perfect installation with two more protectors to spare.I've had this protector on for a few months now. I abuse my phone; store it in dusty and scratchy places.  I just clean the screen protector with a dampened microfiber and it looks just like new.
0.9973595	0.73136806	Easy to put, perfect size I recommend this product! Is good to protect your iPhone ! Very very good! :)
0.6937297	0.71928436	Got this after reading reviews.  The instructions are not very clear.  I tried a few times to decipher them and realized that the tabs belong on the machine and not the actual screen.  Who knew?  Once I got the tabs on, slipping the privacy screen on was easy.  One thing is that the right side to place the screen on is not clear.  I figured out that the logo would be facing me and that's how I installed it but I am not sure it works good enough when I look at my computer from the side.  I can still see what's on my screen.  I tried reversing the screen but it is the same so I do not think it works very well.
0.98882896	0.7925920999999999	It works great. If you are patient it goes on easily and makes it easier to clean the screen when little sticky fingers use my phone
0.99876136	0.85021716	It provides a nice HD gloss protection, I loved the product would definitely recommend to anyone looking for quality at a affordable price!
0.9974860999999999	0.8322016999999999	I am so happy with this screen protector. Such a great value! The screen covers the entire screen with the exception of the home button and the ear audio areas. Absolutely love it!
0.998526	0.81513554	very nice and easy to install. clear and easy on the touch. very protective. come with extra ones for future re use
0.8945934999999999	0.76343113	Bought them for my new iPhone 5.  Went on with ease, first try!  In the past I've gone through about 2 or 3 screen protectors at a time since they always get bubbles or tiny pieces of dust trapped underneath them.  Not the case with the Tech Armor protectors.  Definitely going to buy these exclusively for every iPhone I ever own.
0.99765396	0.82583	Easy to to fit, great value. No issues with restriction of touch screen. I would recommend this product to everyone
0.99088967	0.8288636	I have never been more pleased with a screen protector. It is practically invisible and the little &#34;lint tape&#34; that comes with it helped to make sure there was no lint or marks. I have noticed I need to clean fingerprints a little more often, probably because of the super slick finish. Really well packaged. I wasn't expecting such a professional and awesome product for the price.
0.97587353	0.6865415	Good screen protector, easy to install without blubbles. so it seems clear that there is no film. Very Good price.
0.32372198	0.6232664000000001	"At first this screen protector had a ton of bubbles and just wouldn't sit right.  It looked like bad window tint.  The screen also was ""grabby"" and somewhat sticky.  It was horrible.  I went through the first two screens and same result.  Pushing the bubbles didn't really help.THEN I realized that the sticky tabs have different numbers!  In my rush to install it I overlooked that you need to pull off tab #1 first.  The two sides of the screen protector are not the same!  The directions on the inside do state this (though it's subtle), but the directions on the package exterior don't mention it at all.I used the third screen and made sure to pull tab #1 this time and it went on PERFECTLY.  It basically sucks itself to the screen (see the video on their website) and there wasn't a single bubble.  Now I just need to buy another set for my wife's phone.So the product itself is great, though the directions could be a little more clear about the two different sides.  Maybe add a bright card with a warning or something.  Hope this helps someone."
0.012981771999999999	0.468816	These screen protectors are very flimsy and they also bubble up way too much when trying to apply them to the phone.  I used to work at a cellular company and I have never seen such a bad screen protector product.  Do not waste your money on these because you will be highly disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!
0.6363148000000001	0.6367636999999999	Great protection, anti-fingerprint and the lifetime replacement warranty is sort of like the cherry on top. If you dislike stains on your iphone screen then, this item is for you.
0.93216723	0.8324306999999999	These protectors have been really great so far! They don't seems to affect the touch-sensitivity of the iPhone and they are very clear!***UPDATE*** As you may see from the comments below, I thought the alignment of the top holes were off, but the are intentionally made that way so to not cover two hidden sensors on the black iPhone. My apologies! Great screen protectors!
0.9816152	0.7538179	This is a very good screen protector if you like the matte finish.  It is truly matte, anti-fingerprint and anti-glare.  It works just as described, but as I stated in the heading, I prefer a the Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector.  I gave the remaining two screen protectors to my, who loves them.
0.99896383	0.8799393	This screen protector is GREAT! It looks great on my iphone 5 and does not have any bubbles. It was a breeze to put on and only took about a minute. I have dropped my phone several times and the screen is perfectly secure and protected. GREAT BUY !!!
0.98861754	0.70165133	Received this item days before the first date I was given for it to arrive. The screen fits perfectly on my iphone 5.  I would definitely buy this product again! :)
0.99231017	0.7627505	Good quality and easy to apply on Iphone. Really like the feeling of the touch screen and gives good protection
0.012311041000000002	0.33955467	One of the worst screen protectors I've ever bought. The matte finish is garbage. It might not leave fingerprints but it de-pixelates the screen. When the screen is white it becomes fuzzy. Sticking to the $2 screen protectors from here on out.
0.9941198	0.7223555	This is the best screen protector I've ever used. It looks very good on my iPhone. i really love it.
0.979037	0.73405373	Thank God this came with three screen protectors because I needed them. It took me three tries to get it on my iphone even after watching the assembly video, but it could be that i just don't have nimble fingers. I love the anti-glare and matte finish, I could use it in direct sunlight which is awesome. It is also hard to scratch so that's good as well. Wholes match up perfectly to my iphone 5. If I could have gotten this on in one try I would have given it 5 stars.
0.81824213	0.7279299	I thought using matte cover I can't see clearly but I was wrong so I'm glad  I chose this. Today I scratched my phone and thank goodness I have this cover to protect it. Not even visible! I like that it includes dust sticker to pick up tiny dust on the screen before placing the cover. No bubbles and easy to apply. It's very durable!
0.33226278	0.5606972	This is the first screen protector I have ever applied in my life that had a ZERO bubble installation. By Zero bubble I mean I didn't even have to use the squeegee! I just peeled off the mask a little past the home button and pushed it against my iphone and peeled the rest off.
0.97689617	0.6831124	Great product! Now I know my new phone is protected and I am far less likely to damage the screen!
0.9714209	0.53254455	Easy to install the film clear HD definition is really good. I prefer the antiglare one but i am happy to have it
0.11143002	0.5062824	While this product is good, it took all 3 screen protectors to get it on right. So, while the package contains 3 protectors, 2 were wasted since they cannot be re-used. Luckily got it right the third time. Once installed it is fine.
0.9999125	0.9004128	This product was very easy to put on and looks great. I had an invisiShield on my old iPod and really liked it so I was skeptical to switch brands. I was very impressed with how cheap and easy this screen was to install. It looks great too. I would highly recommend this. You also get three screens which you can't really beat. :)
0.99394286	0.779485	they came a great time, and had everything I needed in the packaging the were easy to put on and its nice will no glare or finger prints on them.
0.62358344	0.69694614	I love this.  I can text without having to hide my text around others now.  They can't see what I am texting unless they are directly over me or I show them.  It kind of takes away from the cuteness of the phone, but that's ok.
0.9983463	0.77975404	The protective sheet is easy to install, and the image on the iPhone after installation is impeccable.  Overall an excellent product at a great price.
0.8413360999999999	0.7658348	This is by far the clearest, smoothest and above all, the easiest to apply screen protector I have ever used. I could not be happier with my purchase. Tech Armor has my vote!UPDATE: I have now been using the Tech Armor screen protector for 1 week and cannot believe how smooth it feels to the touch. Fingers just glide on it. It feels every bit as smooth to the touch as the naked screen and it is crystal clear as well. I like it so much that I just ordered anther.Update: Sad to say that I am not at all happy with my second pack of the Tech Armor screen protector for my iPhone 5. The home button cutout is no longer round. It is U shaped. And the film itself is nowhere near as smooth as my first batch. It attracts lots of fingerprints. Needles to say... I will not be buying Tech Armor anymore and cannot recommend them at all.
0.92165947	0.81780314	I have never used a matte screen protector but I love the idea behind them. This one definitely has no glare, nor does it leave any fingerprints. The protector went on extremently easily and perfectly on my first attempt. There were no air bubbles and it lined up just right. It is thicker than others I have used in the past which I think helps with the air bubbles and lint issues you get with thinner screen protectors.So, the application of the protector was flawless....However, this has made the resolution of my screen so grainy I feel like I need glasses. It actually gives me a headache to look at it. I have tried adjusting my brightness, tilting it different ways but it does not help. The wonderful retina display of the iphone 5 is diminished so badly I do not think the protection is justified.Perhaps this may be a good choice to use when I go to the beach for vacation or something when I need to prevent glare from the sun ( and when I dont look at it all day). But for day to day use, I cannot use it. I have ordered the old school clear protectors and will just deal with the fingerprints and glare, at least I can see my screen.
0.99679667	0.77141273	It fits my iphone very well. Looks nice and it provides protection needed. Now my iphone is well protected and will look new always.
0.9633796	0.809394	Crystal Clear, after it's on you can't even tell you have one. As close to rocking your phone naked as you can go.
0.5377184	0.64490473	When I took it out and placed it on my Iphone, the protective layer was hard to remove. I wasted the first one. Good thing there's more than one. In every other aspect, it works just as advertised..
0.8894052	0.7880843000000001	Super nice, anti-glare is not over bearing and does not compromise the clarity of the new screen as much as others i have seen.
0.9773521999999999	0.7554515	I was tempted to buy the really cheap screen protectors, but after reading the reviews I decided to spend some extra money and try these out.  I watched their instructional video, and tried to follow their instructions to the letter.  I was able to achieve a near-perfect installation on my iPhone 5, and after a couple of weeks, the screen protector looks like new.  I don't know how long it will last, but so far it has performed great.  In my opinion, it's worth the extra money to buy something that applies relatively easily and stands up to daily wear.
0.68151027	0.62145334	"Tech Armor Apple iPhone 5 Premium Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] - Retail PackagingAn iPhone 5 is a big investment, even for a Bond Chick like me. See, half of your funds purchase the phone and service; the other half is spent keeping it unblemished, unbroken--and, if possible--untouchable. It's sleek and pristine with mucho APPLE mystique; you're a cool dude, now. You start identifying with it, syncing with it, even. YOU ARE IPHONE. You introduce yourself at parties as ""[Last name... First name, Last name]."" When you go for your holster and pull out an iPhone, PLEASE DON'T HAVE A TECH ARMOR Premium Anti-Glare and Anti-Fingerprint (Matte; read OPAQUE) p-o-s on it, people! Doing so will totally RUIN YOUR IMAGE in more ways than one. First of all, no more James Bond. It'll be more like Bozo, James Bozo. Remember that cautionary tale by Hans about the emperor, the dude who thought he was so cool, so suave, and whoever couldn't see that was daft? Well, you're that emperor and you're one's deluded because once they see your investment, the crowds will gasp, ""THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S AN iPHONE! THAT'S NO 'BRILLIANT RETINA DISPLAY!'"" Your iPhone isn't PROPERLY covered, dude. It's the same as being naked in public.Did you fall for it, 007? So did I. I bought qty3X3-Pack and found that Tech Armor DOESN'T COVER the full-frontal glass on my iPhone. It seems to be MISSING a cut-out hole at the top, right-of-center! No air bubbles at first, but just put it in your pocket, pull it out again, and... PRESTO! The placement is now CROOKED, and GEOMORPHIC AIR POCKETS transverse the screen. Because of its relative rigidity, the Tech Armor cannot abide air pockets; SMALL RIDGES FORM in the material as I try to smooth it down. I toss the first protector and try another and another--4 in all--with no success. The last one still HALF-ADHERES (one corner is totally d&eacute;tach&eacute;) to ""protect"" my iPhone as I shop for a different brand, but deciphering secret-coded TEXT MESSAGES through billowy haze whilst effecting the deportment of l'espionnage is humiliating. In fact, it's A TRULY IMPOSSIBLE MISSION. When I've got a better screen protector and can go back undercover, I'll use the remaining Tech Armors for lifting fingerprints."
0.9969514000000002	0.7116169	Prompt delivery and excellent screen protector.  Many complains about bubbles, but if you follow the instructions and clean the screen dust free before installing it, you can get bubble free screen protector every time.  Installed on 4 iPhone 5 for family, and everyone is happy.
0.9736359	0.8978719999999999	Nice clear look, went on almost painlessly with no bubbles.  I would recommend opening up the holes and slots just a bit, they are nearly identical in size to the lens, ear speaker, and button so you have to get it aligned nearly perfectly (took me two tries to get it straight).  Does show fingerprints pretty easily, but so does the actual screen.  Doesn't interfere with Ringke SlimFit case at all.
0.9851135	0.7924491	I've purchased $20 screen protectors, and this which came with 3! Easy to install. Can hardly tell its there. No problem with bubbling.This is probably the best screen cover I've ever used.
0.9979347	0.87827694	The matte texture allows to quick typing/gliding over the screen while still providing the anti-glare protection. Perfect fit, easy install, and this is the only type of screen protector I purchase for my phones.
0.73161304	0.6084848	I loved it at first, but after 6 months of use it has faded. I have an extra one at home to replace mine, but I am not 100% satisfied only because of that. I gave it as gifts to family and friends for Christmas and they all loved it, though.
0.8192069	0.55814165	The screen protector works well, once you get one on. I had trouble getting one on properly even though I followed the instructions. Very good chance it was me since my husband had no problem.  Now for customer service - outstanding. I contacted customer service when I was not able to properly apply the screen protector. I provided information as to the issues I encountered hoping they might be able to tell me what additional steps I can take. Not only did I get a response, I was shipped replacements. The reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the difficulty I personally had applying the screen protector.
0.6780316999999999	0.55532086	I like these screen covers because I don't want the phone to get any thicker than it has to be.  Seems fine.
0.9207927	0.83579624	Buy these things at one of the large stores and it would cost 3-4 times the price paid for Tech Armor. The pack comes with three protectors, and although it took me a little while to work out exactly which one goes on the phone (it's the middle one!), it takes a few attempts to line it up properly, but once on, a couple of small air bubbles were very easy to remove. I've used various screen protectors in the past, and without exception have pretty much ripped them all off very quickly as they either dull the screen or have air in them, or whatever. These ones are phenomenally cheap, and so far are working perfectly.
0.13912255	0.5667213000000001	overall looks cheap and if you pay close attention it's actually smaller than the screen (at least 1mm on each side)
0.98292404	0.87634146	very easy to apply, fingerprints/grease doesn't stand out at all unless the phone is tiled in a certain angle. Even if it does, it is very easy to clean.  Wonderful and inexpensive product.
0.99857974	0.87136126	The Tech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protectors are awesome!!!  The matte screen  makes reading texts and emails much easier on the eyes.  I love the Lifetime Replacement Warranty as well.  Tech Armor provides excellent customer service/support.  We had a bubble that we were not able to remove by the home button.  I emailed the Tech Armor Support Team and had a replacement pack sent out as soon as I provided confirmation of my mailing address.  Application tips were also shared with me to successfully apply the protector the second time.  They definitely want their customers to be completely happy with their product....and I am!!!!
0.9931840000000001	0.7449832	The screen works as advertised.  I like the matte finish and touch sensitivity.  I messed up installing the 1st film.  The 2nd film turned out perfect!  Good to have 3 films with the package.  Great product!  It's a keeper!
0.9915719000000001	0.70300996	This is a great product, easy to install. A must buy for the iPhone 5.  I will buy it again.
0.9087943000000002	0.6476261	good resolution and easy to applywill be better if each screen came with it's one flannel so it wont accumulate dust
0.99955225	0.8948988999999999	Easy to apply, and flexible.  Holes are in the correct places and screen protector fits perfectly.  I'm very satisfied.  The surface is SO clear it's almost nonexistent.  Very easy to use and no negative affect for swiping across the screen or pressing the touch screen.  Excellent and the reassurance from the company if I did have a problem has been reinforced by them numerous times.  Gotta say, IMPRESSIVE!
0.8918686	0.68014663	3m privacy protector is much better than this one - i recomend the 3m over this any day.  Secruity and durability is better with 3m.
0.3784494	0.5929954000000001	So far so good.  I like this screen protector better than my previous ZAGG because it actually covers in the entire screen.  My ZAGG did not cover the ear phone section of the phone. Needless to say it got all dirty and started peeling off. It could be that that the dude who installed it didn't know what he was doing. That is another good point with this cover, is that it's dry installation.  And so what if it gets messed up - it's a pack of 3.
0.9711805	0.75800145	(PRO) I like the screen protector, you can barely see the screen from odd angles.(CON) The definition on my screen is a bit blurred and Im surprised that the SP scratches as easy as it does.Overall I still recommend the product, it gets the job done well!
0.99272716	0.87956023	After reading so many reviews on the different protectors out there, I finally chose Tech Armor, hoping for the best when I went to apply it (this is our first experience with a Smartphone, let alone an iPhone.  I made sure to read the directions and am thrilled to say I applied the first one on my phone with ease and applied the second to my husband's phone with similar ease (two teeny specks of dust got caught beneath the screen, but what can you do other than your best? and it's not noticeable when he's using his phone).  So, we still have an extra screen protector for the future and I'm planning on stocking up with more Tech Armor the next time I order from Amazon.  What I love about the way one applies the screen protector is that each protector has two layers of thin plastic sheeting that you peel off, so no fingerprints or scratches can possibly mar the protector until after it's completely applied.  You peel off the layer covering the adhesive as you line up and lay the screen protector on the phone (and I had no problems getting it lined up correctly) and then after you push out any air bubbles using the little card they give you, you peel off the second layer, which has covered the surface of the screen protector up until that point.  For our first experience, I am a very satisfied customer.  Thank you so much!
0.8972234	0.70694673	When I received my iPhone 5 I immediately installed a wet application screen protector, but was unhappy with the final results. After some research, I found these screen protectors and have been very happy with my purchase. I applied the first one quickly without any bubbles and I like the feel of it a lot more than the thicker wet application protector. The holes match up perfectly and it looks and feels as if there is nothing on the screen. I would definitely recommend the HD screen protector.
0.9484735999999999	0.6271289000000001	Easy to install, without bubles, i like it.2 mins only and its installed. i used it with  i-BLASON Premium Apple New iPhone 5 Bumper Case. No issues till now.
0.99497896	0.8152529000000001	Easy to put on.  Good directions made it easy.  Arrived very quickly.  Adhered better to my I phone than others I have had in the past.
0.97592413	0.76277745	perfect fit - installed first try with no bubbles - fast delivery will definitly buy again when needed - very clear like nothing is there
0.62546855	0.7778491	I wish I had known what matte meant and what is does to the fidelity of the picture on the phone. It looked like you rubbed all of your face greases on it and it got stuck like that forever! Why would I want to stifle the iPhone's gorgeous retina display just so it won't get fingerprints and you can see the screen in the sun. What good is fingerprint and glare protection of you can't really see the amazing quality picture wherever you are. Was disappointed.
0.89787155	0.7880758000000001	Did the trick admirably. Glad they included three of them in the package because I botched the first two (dust on the adhesive side is there to stay). The effect is a smooth surface for sliding and poking and a matt finish that virtually eliminates glare.
0.92715526	0.81705344	I read in people's reviews that these people are very quick to refund, and I did not/do not want to take *unfair* advantage of that. So bought three of these 3-packs (on at a time) in order for me to get 2 iPhone 5's covered, that's 9 screens to get 2 working, and, yes, seven screens in the trash.Now, I very seriously considered giving five star regardless, because these screens are nothing short of amazing!! ...Once you do get them on *without* any of those *!^@$ dust bubbles! The air bubbles are no problem at all as they get wiped right off with just one swipe with that little business card sized &#34;wiper-offer&#34; thingy that's included in the package. But *one* bubble that has the tiniest speck of dust and you gotta do it all over again with a new screen! No wonder they've got 3 in every package, plus the sticky plastic sheet they also have in there to remove dust particles from the phone's screen. The problem is that the dust particles stay stuck to the sticky side of the screen protector not to the iphone's screen. Hence going through 9 of'm to get 2 on.My house is not dusty, and I am quite adept with my hands, I'm always adding memory/drives/pci add-ons, what have you to my laptop and desktop computers. I tend to fuss with things a lot. I've  owned almost every iPhone and I've systematically added the Zagg InvisiShields to them (mine and my wife's). All this to say that I am at least not less handy than the average person, that these are intend for (right?). I've always had the Zagg(ies) except for the one time where (both my wife and myself) had it done (this was for the 4 I think) by the guy at the mall, whose product was a little less &#34;orange peal-y&#34; than Zagg's (in fairness it also came off quicker than Zagg's, but I digress...)Well here's the bottom line: These are a hundred times better than anything I've ever had on any iPhone, no &#34;orange peal&#34; effect whatsoever! Just be ready to hold your breath and be very focused when you go to put them on. I would totally recommend these over anything out there: once they're on &#34;they're gone&#34;!! It's as if the phone is naked!I really am having a hard time only giving four stars! But when it's all said and done, it shouldn't be this hard to put the screen on. I will keep an eye out and if I get feedback that they do deserve that fifth star then I'll add it, so there may be an update to this in the near future. Heck! I might add it without the feedback just because of the way I feel about this screen myself.Once again, bottom line is: Get it! It really is incredible! Just be read for a few sweat beads!
0.9752921999999998	0.7518573000000001	Excellent product.. Of course, when applied, the resolution of your screen wont appear to be as crisp, but that is what your willing to give up for 360 privacy.. also, this product does not leave any grease stains or fingerprints behind, so your phone always looks great..Definitely the way to go if you want a quality screen protector!
0.9983711	0.78491414	Product was easy to install with instructions. It works as described.  Great bargain for 3 covers.  I would recommend this product for iphone users.
0.35658836	0.32083428	I chose the rating because I haven't had the Protector long enough to really judge it. I do like it because I don't have the finger smudges that appeared on the screen after using an Ap or dialing the phone.
0.9835074	0.84155357	This has to be one of the easier screen protectors that I've purchased and applied myself!It's thin, barely recognizable and does a great job of protecting the screen. Plus, the price was a steal.
0.98603356	0.71469456	Awesome screen protector. Matte is definitely the way to go. Easy to install. Even better that its a three pack
0.9934248999999999	0.7159488	Its a great product to buy. I love it and it is so easy to put on the screen I would buy it again if I needed to.
0.96543574	0.78548867	hands down the best screen protector for your iphone very durable and a grate price for a 3 pack. one of the mall stands sells one of these for $10 when you could get it for less then $5 on amazon
0.04764557	0.51538867	Didn't work that well.  Kept rising up off the surface of the phone. Just pay a little extra for a better product
0.65003246	0.5729468000000001	It is not easy to apply on the screen, but it feels very smooth . I like it. I hope it could be a little thicker so that it will protect itself from scratching.
0.5820850000000001	0.47252634	this anti glare screen shield is not 3 layered, unlike the clear one which is protected with 2 films on both sides. The anti glare shield has only one shield attached to the actual screen shield. I haven't applied it to my phone yet since my phone hasn't arrived. i am afraid that when applying, the shield will be scratched easily if i try to use the card attached in the package to drive away the bubbles. I'll update this after application.update:It's not difficult to apply and after a few days, I still don't see any visible scratch. My phone is also protected in an otterbox case. It's nice to have a matte look to the screen.
0.96798587	0.7957649	Bought this for two new iphones (3 in a pack), and watched the video first.  I always managed get a piece of lint on the screen protector in the past but the suggestion of lifting up the screen protector with scotch tape, and then using another piece of scotch tape to remove the lint was wonderful.  Got two PERFECT applications without lint or bubbles.
0.9845511999999998	0.7688351999999999	The screen protector is fantastic, I don't have to worry about people snooping over my shoulder and reading my texts. It also protected my screen from 2 horrible scratches. I need to get another screen protector, but I'd rather spend 10 bucks than 100 for a repair. Well worth the buy
0.98234755	0.7038319000000001	product performed as described - i installed on iphone5, followed instructions and you can not tell protector is on - good product, good valve.
0.99927807	0.8444254000000001	Love this screen cover.  Works great with my speck case.  Easy to install.  No bubbles underneath.  The screen is very easy to see, and there is no change in the touch screen that I have noticed.  Definitely a great buy.
0.9925107	0.81751496	Protector goes on easy and looks fabulous.  Gives the screen a less slippery feel and touch commands seem to react better.  Gives the phone's screen a flat, less mirror like appearance.  The anti-glare works great and its the best protector that I have ever seen.
0.25497794	0.42773512	fast shipping item is what i expected it to be , should have more per pack , not that i will be changing them out every week , but it would be nice to have a few extra for what it is and what i pay for
0.02060625	0.44148195	The screen protectors I received were in bad shapes. They were not properly packaged. It seemed to me that this guy just put 3 of them together from his garage, very unprofessional!  The goods were sent by regular mail in a white envelope with bad hand writing on it. I thought someone i know has just sent a letter!
0.68270564	0.67747545	This shield does not glare and was easy to attach. Fingerprints do not show and it provides some protection from scratches.
0.98317385	0.808373	I really like the screen protectors! They are very easy to apply and it doesn't leave any air bubbles.. The cut outs for the top and bottom are very centered...Plus is super affordable!
0.0006224811	0.52815235	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.  COMPLETELY USELESS.Tried all three of these screen protectors and they all failed.  Has Power Support screen protector on my old iphone that kept is looking brand new even two years later.  Tried this product because of the reviews.  Horrible.  Went back to Power Support and set and reset the screen protector severval times without any issues.
0.3755837	0.6053134	the cover is great, it's just the fit. difficult to put on because it is a little short on the sides, by the time I got to the top of the screen, the holes didn't match up. Turns on they don't match up so that's what you have to live with.
0.9987520000000001	0.78575397	Great screen protector and inexpensive!  Easy to apply and perfect for the iphone 5.  Great if you want protection for your screen and anti-glare!
0.35900337	0.48714754	I just got my new iPhone 5.  Great product and wanted to get a top notch screen protector on it right away.  My new case came with a cheap screen protector and it did not fit right, so I ordered one from these guys hoping for the best.I watched the installation video and carefully prepared my phone, as instructed.  The protector went on as indicated but several small bubbles at the beginning and the end on the protector were impossible to get out.  So I left them there and will try again with the second one from the package, after this first one need replacing. Now I see why you get three screen savers in a package, because the first one was crappy.
0.9979379	0.873682	The Tech Armor HD Screen Protectors are everything they promise to be.Easy to apply, little or no air bubbles remained on the first application. The cutouts for mic, camera and button are exact (unlike others that are more expensive), and the overall size is perfect so as not to lift up when popping on a cover with edges close to screen.Very clear, great look. Customer service was also good after a mix-up with delivery address.I would highly recommend this product.
0.36029774	0.46166518	A little difficult to get right,but they sent three and I only wasted one! It takes a little practice to get it on straight and get all the bubbles out, but worth it to protect the screen.
0.788453	0.707771	I love the finish on this screen protector. It is a dull finish that doesn't fingerprint. I would definitely buy again.
0.99276257	0.7859414	I admit I was nervous to apply this screen protector so I watched the video and thought ........yeah right, it will go on that easily......... To my surprise it did go on just how the video showed it would.  Unlike some more expensive screen protectors i've used, you really don't notice it on your phone at all.  I am sold, in fact I am buying tech armor for my iPad now. The lifetime warranty is also nice.
0.995137	0.8771197000000001	Got these for my parents since they're previous protectors didn't hold up. These screen protectors fit perfectly. The warranty puts them at ease also.It was also very easy to apply.
0.8911380999999999	0.64804864	Great product, good price ! Not easy to install but that my only problem.  I just used the first one, save one for my husband.
0.8837707	0.6418989	Great fit and feel.  Make sure you use the tool that come with it to ensure you do not have bubbles on the screen.  Good product!
0.9756535	0.7484958	This product is pretty good, very light and durable. Since the iPhone 5 is light already, the case adds a bit of weight, offering not only protection, but gives a bit of weight so it feels like a phone.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
0.9698972	0.7183752	The Tech Armor works well and was as easy as any to apply. I took a little work because i got a few specks of dust, but the dust remover provided was a great help. I am now bubble free!
0.67720115	0.5669494	As far as &#34;screen protectors&#34; go, this one is no different than any of the others.  The thing that bothered me the most was trying to apply it exactly right and then having to remove the &#34;bubbles&#34; was almost impossible.  I, personally, won't even use a screen protector because it's just too much trouble!!!
0.9992317	0.87127537	These screen protectors are amazing.The screen appears and acts the same with the protector as it did without.You can't even tell there is anything on the screen.The instructions are easy to follow and the application is very simple.I am very impressed with this product and this company.
0.97517216	0.72884727	Great screen protector. Worked perfectly for two iphone 5's and the thing came with three of them which was nice cause I messed up the second one so third one came in handy.
0.98300254	0.81773317	The tech armor screen protector was easy to put on. They also had good instructions from trouble shooting bubbles. Deff a good buy
0.9968241	0.79670936	I have tried many screen protectors suck as the zagg's invisible screen protector and so far tech armor is the best. I love how they give you 3 screen protectors in the package. The only thing I did not like is that it took me 2 tries to get the screen protector on my iphone. Other than that issue I love this product. After I installed the screen protector the following day you can hardly tell the phone has a screen protector on which I love. I recommend this screen protector it is best out there.
0.9698460999999999	0.8810214	I was browsing around for the best screen protector for my iPhone 5 on Amazon, so naturally I set the search parameters to only display results that had at least 4 stars based on prior reviews from other consumers.  One of the first results to appear on the page was this screen protector by Tech Armor.  For the price it was sold at and the number of consistent positive reviews from many different people, it was an easy choice for me to place an order and try it out myself.  Having Amazon Prime, it shipped exceptionally quick and I received it an entire day earlier than the expected delivery date.The package came with 3 screen protectors (as advertised) along with a cleaning cloth and a card to help remove any bubbles after application.  I've had little experience with installing screen protectors in the past, so naturally the results weren't necessarily the best when I applied the screen protector.  There was still some dust that clung onto the adhesive side of the first screen protector after application, likely due to the area that I was performing the installation.  As a result, some bubbles remained that simply could not removed.  Apart from the bubbles that remained due to the few dust particles that stuck on, I can't even tell that there was a screen protector on my iPhone.  It appeared identical to the screen before there was a protector on it, both when it's on and off.  It wasn't too glossy to give it a tacky, plastic look, but at the same time it wasn't dull enough to lessen the quality of the phone's retina display.  It was just right, practically invisible from plain sight.  The texture was not slippery at all, but had a top-quality feel to it (again, almost as if there no was no screen protector applied).The adhesive may have been a little too good, since it was tough to remove(I wanted to remove the first screen protector and try again with the second one so that there will be no bubbles remaining), and the protector ended up having a permanent fold at its upper corner in my efforts to remove the screen protector.  It wasn't a big deal as I had two left to retry applying the screen protector perfectly.  However, I failed all subsequent times since for some reason dust particles kept attaching to the adhesive side of the screen.  I ended up wasting all three screen protectors, and contacted TechArmor on how this issue can be resolved.Much to my surprise, they offered to simply replace the product.  It didn't even take more than three days until the replacements came in, and this time they came with a dust-removal tape.  This time around, I succeeded in applying the screen protector with only two very insignificant bubbles that remained from two dust particles (which happened to just be towards the edge of the phone's screen so it was hardly even visible).  The dust removal tape really came handy, and I thought it was a fantastic addition that showed the seller really pays attention to detail, quality, and customer satisfaction in their products.Overall, my expectations have been exceeded and I will definitely any subsequent screen protectors I may need from them.I recommend that to all those who intend on purchasing a new phone anytime soon, be sure to buy a screen protector from TechArmor first and apply the screen protector immediately before using your new phone.  It'll definitely serve to better give you peace of mind in maintaining your device.(Note to the seller: I actually left feedback earlier , but gave three stars by accident so I removed it, so now I am writing this review with a 5 star rating)
0.10457733	0.6204387	These clear protectors fit nicely. That being said, I expected them not to bubble after peeling back the film covering tabs. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to get a smooth covering.
0.9791700999999999	0.94176894	Screen Protectors are difficult to install is the first thing I want to say. The Tech Armor is no different than some of the more expensive protectors out there and installs the same way and offers the same protection. Price wise, you cannot beat it and there is no reason to spend a penny more for any others out there. This one is top notch.Installation: A little hint, use regular desktop tape to assit with installing. I am not sure how anyone could install one of these skins perfectly without using tape. I used the tape to clean the screen first by applying the tape and picking up the tape on the glass screen surface of the phone. The tape would catch any dust and take it off the screen before applying the protecting skin. Once you follow the directions and lay down the skin on the phone screen, look for dust under the skin. No matter how hard you try, there will be some dust under the skin and between the glass screen. Using desktop tape, place a piece of tape on top of the skin itself where the dust is. The tape has to be long and go over the edge of the skin. Using the tape, lift the skin up. The tape will allow you to lift up and down the skin without using your fingers on the skin itself. Your fingers will make a mess of the skin and leave fingerprints. Pick up the skin (using the tape) where you see the dust and clean the underside of the skin using more tape. Apply the sticky portion of the tape to the area of the underside of the skin that has dust. The tape will remove the dust from the underside of the skin. The adhesive on the tape is stronger than the adhesive on the skin. The skin has a removable adhesive and why the dust will transfer to the tape's adhesive. Once you remove the dust off the underside of the skin, lay the skin back down. You may experience airbubbles and will need to press the air bubbles out. Repeat the steps I mention where ever you see dust. I had to do it about 20 times before it was perfect but it is now perfect. Using the tape to pick the skin up and down also assit with removing air bubbles. The tape must also be simple transparent 3m type desktop tape. Not a high adhesive tape but tape you would use to wrap a present for example. Good luck!
0.97603387	0.7758527	I've been a Zagg customer for years, and always have loved their product but Tech Armor has made me a convert.  Installation is so easy it's crazy.  I didn't have trouble with the bubbles or dust - just made sure everything was clean beforehand.  I have a cover that has a small lid on my IPhone 5 -and it's just fine.  I have 2 extra shields now, and will give one away and keep the other just in case.  Really like the clear look of this and happy with the protection when I throw it in my purse.
0.9566474	0.7914547	I was looking for a heavy-duty screen protector for a dusty climate to go under my Otterbox.  The Tech Armor is a thicker, heavier screen protector that went on easily with few bubbles.  Didn't affect the touchscreen.  Would recommend it to anyone.
0.9978406999999999	0.80592215	Very scratch resistant and easy to clean. Very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is tough on their phone.
0.4569177	0.5478771	My initial try to put these on was not very successful.  I used all three and still ended up with a few bubbles.  I didnt contact the company, since I figured it was my error.  I posted a review on Amazon and mentioned my difficulty, and less than 24 hours later I received an email from Armor Tech telling me they wanted me to be completely satisfied and were shipping me out a new set.  They shipped them the next day on Saturday.  Now THAT's customer service!
0.99586207	0.8384634	This is amazing product. It it stunningly crystal clear and doesn't impact retina display at all.Easy to install and covers 99% of screen (100% would make it difficult to apply and will get peeled off). Nobody can easily figure out that the screen guard is on it. Along with this, Tech Armor provides great customer support. I wish they could come up with more iPhone/iPad accessories like cases/sleeves etc.Thanks again for the great service! Way to go!!!
0.08485067	0.49408266	I bought this as i felt this was cheap for the reviews i read.. I see that it fits pretty well with my new iPhone 5 but for the cuts for cam & speaker... It was a bit too large and i felt that it takes off the elegance of my phone... I ended up by putting the protector that came with my switcheasy case..it did have the perfect cuts... I am not interested in going thru the pains of returning this item rather i may end up using this may be after a year or so...
0.9982822	0.9025724	I followed the written and video instructions and added a few extra steps and had no problems whatsoever in applying this screen protector.As suggested I used the bathroom as my work place.  I ran the shower a few minutes to increase humidity thus minimizing floating dust particles.  Cleaned countertop well and went to work on my device. My first extra step: I cleaned my device thoroughly using a lcd cleaning cloth slightly dampened with the lcd cleaning solution I use on my tvs laptops and computer screens.  Then I cleaned  again with the cloth included in the package. One note about this cloth: it does not have finished edges so initially it did leave a few stray particles on my screen as I polished, but I then folded the edges inward and folded again so no edges were exposed and polished again.  The kit also includes a few pieces of dust removal tape to capture any remaining lint or dust that remains on the screen, I was initially a bit concerned they might leave a residue on the screen, but they worked great picked up the dust and left nothing behind on the screen.  Satisfied that the screen was dust free I proceeded to install the protector film.  Following the directions for install I peeled back about an inch and a half of the backing using the green tab, aligned it with the device as best I could and slowly peeled back the rest of the backing allowing the protector film to come in contact with the entire screen.  This worked like a charm !  I went on like magic, I didn't even need to use the little card they supply to remove bubbles because there were none. This was probably because of a combination of making certain the device was absolutely clean and the higher humidity of the bathroom.  Finished up the install by removing the top layer of plastic using the red tab and polished again with the included cloth.  All cutouts are as they should be and fits  my iPhone 5s perfectly.Note:  This package includes 3 screen protectors so if you do mess up the application you've still got 2 more chances to get it right.  If you thoroughly clean you device and follow the instructions you should have no problems.
0.06540164	0.46906602	This screen protector covers the whole face of the phone. There isn't any space left for anything to get underneath it. Most phone covers will cover up the edges to so it will completely protect the phone.
0.10861969	0.5401803000000001	I have always had great luck in the past with Tech Armor products. Bought numerous Screen Protectors for my old iPhone 4S. I just upgraded to the iPhone 5S and decided to buy the Tech Armor screen protectors again.Maybe I got a bad batch of protectors but they seemed to have trouble sticking to my screen. I made sure I followed the directions precisely, as always. The first attempt the protector kind of just slid off the screen after I pulled tab number 2. With protector 2 and 3 they both just came off the screen when I pulled tab number 2, as if they were forever stuck to tab 2.. As anyone knows, once this happens, there's no second chance at putting it back on.I still gave this 3 stars because overall, I've had really good luck with Tech Armor, just not this time around.EDIT: To those who have made it this far in the reviews should at least read the reply to this review.Tech Armor has some of the greatest Support out there! They are sending me 3 totally new protectors because of the issues I had with the first batch I purchased. So if they aren't too busy churning out a quality product, they are taking care of all of their customers. Will update my star rating too when the new protectors arrive!
0.029545069	0.30062222	Total waste of money. I followed the directions and watched the video, but the screen protector would not stick to my iPhone !  Bought the 3-pack to do 2 phones, but after the disaster with the first one I decided to forget the other phone.  It was a $7.00 learning experience !
0.9907365	0.7917424	"Tech Armor Apple New iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3-Pack) [AT&T;, Verizon.

I followed the directions and still had issues with bubbling, contacted the company and they lived up to their ""Lifetime Guarantee""!  They sent me replacements to me at no cost, very impressive.  If you are on the fence about getting these, just get them, you wont be sorry."
0.85584056	0.6910603	When I received these screen protectors, I thought they were going to be just like any other.  I was pleasantly surprised. They went on with ZERO hassle and no bubbles whatsoever. It doesn't even look like you have a screen protector and above that, you get 3 in a pack and a lifetime warranty! Definitely worth the price!
0.99702275	0.7262589	Very easy to install if you follow the instructions.  Watching the recommended video really helped.  Once on, you can't tell it is there, and it protects the screen very well.
0.9455744	0.89418936	"I received these screen protectors as a promo to review them and also ordered a set at the same time (dont ask why.. it just happens lol).I normally use the green onion supply screen protectors because I hail these as the BEST ever made and I am happy to report the TechArmor ones are right up there in terms of quality, but when it boils down to COST and LONG TERM COST TechArmor wins hands down. I know there is already another review on here for them and I would be in agreement with pretty much the entire review, I hope to add a few additional thoughts.For quick comparison against GOS (green onion supply) lets go ahead and compare.cutouts;GOS: only cut outs are for home button and ear piece.TA: cut out for camera, home button and ear piece.clarity;GOS: clarity is pretty great id say maybe 1% clarity loss on screen.TA: pretty much on par with GOSdurability;GOS: very good, extremely hard to scratch, stands up to LIGHT sand, stands up to keys like a champ.TA: exactly the same, maybe even a little better OR hides scratches better if thats even possible.feel;GOS: little to no friction, get a little bit of oils from your skin on it and its a slip and slide fest. (i prefer this actually)TA: exactly like GOS.cost;GOS: $11.95 @ frys or $14.99 amazon.TA: CHEAP! like $5.99 and $6.99warranty;GOS: little hard, you must send a pic if the screen protector bubbles, etc. and warranty much be ""approved"" WAS A PITA when i had to warranty one.TA: AMAZING. send them a invoice # and you will get a brand new 3pk mailed to you promptly.. this company really cares about customers!overall; TA takes the cake because of the customer service and the warranty and cost.these are not your $1 3-5pk you can get from ebay. they might be low cost but the material is HIGH QUALITY. for $6/$7 its mind blowing they are making profits on these while offering free replacements. i commend this company for not trying to take advantage of people and turn around and charge $15-$20 like other compaines (belkin, powersupport, GOS)personal note;i can attach pictures but i find it pretty pointless to do seeing as there is another review already on the site. again cant recommend these enough!install tip;turn on the shower to as hot as it can go in the bathroom, let it run for 5-10mins to steam up like crazy, lock yourself in there take a seat, clean your phone and apply the screen protector. the steam kills all dust out of the air and you end up with no bubbles or lint. if you have lint use some tape to pull the film up and another piece of tape to get the lint and your good to go. - See more at: [...]"
0.98673725	0.77031004	this is a very good product and has got great quality.no issues with the touch after installing the product.the product came on time as promised
0.9838798000000001	0.8176589	The Tech Arm Anti-glare and anti-Fingerprint Screen Protector is much more easier to install than other types I tried. It has good rigidity yet easier to conform with little or no air bubbles. It's also easy to remove, if the alignment is not perfect, and then reinstall it to get better alignment.
0.007370025	0.51193357	Did not fit the 5C and the material is very thin.  I didn't even use it.
0.92895985	0.6149978	Pleased with first order and made a second order for two more. Like that they are smudge proof and glare proof
0.15313372	0.5013616	but the front camera and earphone opening  does not match the phone, I thought I was the one misplacing it XD
0.6660826999999999	0.7103961	The screen protector does the job. I have had it for a few months now and have no scratch neither on my phone nor on the screen protector. It is easily applicable on the phone, the instructions are clear, you can even view an online video if you want to.Very please. Would recommend.
0.9921761999999998	0.81352437	The screen protector fits like a glove and was easy to apply. It also has a nice texture. It was a little pricy but it's worth it
0.9941187	0.79815316	Very good screen protector. Easy to put on and it has a nice matte feel. Good clarity as well and no bubbles after applying.
0.6274488	0.60741025	I really wanted to give this product 4.5 star and since there is no Sych option I was torn between 4 and 5 but ended up giving 5. Ok the major reason I wanted to take off half star is that you will still get fingerprints on your screen but except that everything is great, the film sticks very easy and there is no problem with bubbles at all and YAS it's super clear!
0.6074732	0.7439339	this anti glare protector is really great. It turn the screen a less bright and makes the iphone have a mate look similar to the kindle.  It is very soft to the fingers and it does not leave trace of fingers
0.9945533000000001	0.82410866	The cut was perfect. Installation was easy. I recommend watching Tech Amor's installation video. It took less than 2 minutes to install and got it right the first time.
0.99102175	0.6185461999999999	I never write reviews but this screen protector is the best works exactly as it says. It may not be 100% perfect but i love it...& is super easy to install.
0.022173196000000003	0.3373884	No label indicating adhesive side?  Ruined all three. Skinomi products are way better. Dont buy this product if you want to be happy with your purchase.
0.99422014	0.819628	It is the best of all the choices... It is clear and easy to put on..  The instructions were clear and you cannot tell there is a protector on the phone! Strongly recommend!
0.6222377	0.6320316999999999	The screen protector works way better than I thought it would. Almost invisible and cuts way down on the glare, which is a plus when you're in the drive-thru at Starbucks (lol).
0.9710511999999999	0.80984604	Went on smoothly, no bubbles if you follow directions. We simply love the protection from scratches and there is no static to collect dust. Fingerprints are kept to a minimum.
0.98904824	0.5658119	Easy instructions and fast application, though do very carefully! Great item for Iphone 5 protection with fast shipping! Will buy in the future!
0.89163697	0.7325014	It's an awesome product.  You won't feel that a protector layer is placed on it.  Out of the 3, I messed up one (I used the wrong side to stick it) the second worked out well and the third one also worked well - I did that for my friend.  It's really worth.
0.85425925	0.6987865	Not finger print prof after a while, but still really good.. do the job... for the price, great buy. great price!
0.990708	0.71237683	I would recommend this product to everyone that has an I PHONE 5. Great buy for the price get em while they're hot
0.2381764	0.73904073	The screen protector appears to be able to protect the screen against accidental scratches.  The directions indicate to line up the bottom of the screen with the protector and apply the protector to the iPhone screen from bottom to top. A small hole in the protector for the front facing camera lens is provided but it is hit or miss in terms of being able to center this hole with the lens.The quality of the display will be slightly compromised due to oils from the fingers being deposited and retained on the protector.  This will be more evident when using the phone in the presence of daylight, for example.  It will also be more noticed when the screen is dark.Also, the font size of the included directions is almost too small to see with the naked eye.  You may want to read the directions on-line.I would recommend the product.  I cannot comment on how scratch resistant the iPhone screen itself is when subject to common items that can scratch the screen, i.e., keys in the pocket along with the iPhone.  However, if you want peace of mind, get this product.  I would also strongly recommend a case from Speck to protect the phone from bumps.  The grip of the phone with the Speck case installed is much better when compared to the grip of the iPhone without a protective case.  The screen protector is slightly smaller than the phone itself thus allowing the Speck case to fold over the front of the phone by a half millimeter without moving the screen protector out of its installed position.
0.08824772	0.5502014000000001	Good product but not satisfied with the quality of it. Film became non sticky after a while (1month) and began to peel. Not scratch resistance and glue or whatever they use residue will be noticed when applying to screen.
0.9861911	0.80248535	easy to install with a good price. I recommend to install in a bathroom with a lot of steam.This avoid the air bubbles.
0.058108777	0.44617608	So this product comes with 3 screen protectors. The first two I tried didn't stick to my phone, by the time I got to the third one I got bubbles and didn't have another chance.
0.5022475000000001	0.56483984	Looks great after installed and delivers the promise of no glare, reflex, stain and grease..... however, looks like some sensitivity from screen was taken... nothing serious until now.
0.6916821999999999	0.5986829	"It seems that this has been the hardest screen protector to apply... The rest I have had for previous phones have been a breeze. I finally wanted to get a ""better brand"" screen protector and it's just too hard to set it right. Don't get me wrong it seems it would work since I have oily hands I wish u could get it on so now just gotta cross my fingers I don't mess up the other two... :/"
0.98841304	0.7740561	the tech armor iphone 5, Its very easy to put and looks very clear as well.I recomend it a lot.
0.11332714599999999	0.4443015	I tried to put this on the iphone and didn't succeed putting it on. Have used other brands before and didn't have much difficulty. So I basically destroyed one and gave up on putting the other that came in the package.
0.996202	0.82482576	Easy to apply (lower incidence of bubbles than any protector I've used before) and gorgeous appearance.  Incredibly clear.  I honestly had to check after applying to make sure it was on there and hadn't just come off when I peeled back the second protective layer.Great deal for the price and an awesome product.  Would recommend for any smartphone.
0.9664221	0.7888236999999999	I like the anti-glare, but that's more of a personal preference. They make it easy to put on with the flexibility to re-align if necessary.  I found a few pieces of dust floated on the adhesive (was in the air so was unavoidable), so I peeled it back up and used scotch tape to remove it and it went down bubble-free and perfect. The guarantee is great, plus you get three for an unbeatable price.
0.8538374	0.70512336	Let me first say that this screen protector is one of the best I ever had. It's feels great and is smooth and just blends right in with my case. It came with 3 screen protectors and I only got to use one of them, as I followed the instructions the screen protectors would keep getting dirty and there were so many air bubbles. I just gave up at one point and had to take the last remaining screen protector that I had to an AT&T store so they could set it up the correct way. I love the screen protector but it was the worst time of my day trying to put it on.
0.68190217	0.6024316999999999	Not going to go into much detail here, we're talking screen protectors.  Protector fits the iphone 5 very well, and appears to be made of a quality material.  No negatives.
0.8635326999999999	0.6727093000000001	My girlfriend had no problem pitting this on my new iPhone. Thee only thing is I can't see the screen when it's bright outside but I bet that is ever screen. I love that it, really doesn't leave that fingerprint mark on the screen, a must buy for any phone really.
0.9485545	0.6802395999999999	It seems to be holding up well, time will be the real test... This was easy to install and hardly noticable
0.9618858	0.6739644	love that this protector is anti glare, 3pk for the price is a good buy, i would have been nice if the company made a back film protector as well.
0.91548145	0.6942725000000001	Does the job! Matte surface but does not detract appreciably from beauty of screen. Happy with purchase. No more fingerprints.
0.9665860000000001	0.7724762	I only have this for a couple of days but it looks like a good screen protector.Applying this was a bit tricky but not more than other screen protectors I've used. I wish they had marked the side that faces the phone and the outside facing side clearly... It's easy to figure out though by feeling which side is sticky and which one isn't.I managed to apply this with minimal bubbles and so far it's been great, I don't even notice I have a cover on.
0.93988776	0.78661585	I've never been able to get a screen protector on my phone without bubbles or dust getting underneath. These are the first ones that really work - it includes not only a dust cloth but a tape to get those tiny dust specs. Went on really easily with no bubbles! Love this product.
0.9941937	0.7614012	this product arrived super fast and it was very easy to install. the youtube videos were also helpful. It served its purpose, no complaints from me
0.9766189000000001	0.80796385	This took me about five minutes to install on my phone.  I watched the online video beforehand, and then was able to install it without any bubbles.  It took me about three tries because I had a little trouble aligninng the cutouts perfectly, but I used only 1 protector and still have 2 for later.  Also, the company will give you free replacements if you cannot install it properly with the 3 provided!The matte finish is nice, and protects from fingerprints.  It does change the quality of the colors a little bit, but I don't mind.  The anti-glare is nice to look at the screen in the sunlight.I definitely recommend this item!
0.018054903	0.61848146	i did not like these anti glare screen protectors, because they weren't cut properly. they are too narrow for the screen. it seems hardly worth making them just for such a small amount of material missing from each protector, and getting returns, and a bad name as well.
0.9951108	0.8428136	I ordered the Tech Armor Screen protection cover for my iphone5 and I lovedit. It was easy to instal. The cover fits properly to my phone screen. One more good thing is that there are three protective covers. Incase I mess up with one I still have an extra one.The product was shipped on time .Great value for a reasonable price.
0.9468609	0.609632	Best i ever had! Only complain is that there is a bubble i cant fix at upper corner. But so far i don't even notice and feels like there is nothing between my fingertips and the screen. LOVE IT!
0.9909686	0.79660136	It really protects your phone from scratches, you can read even in the brightest sunny day without squinting your eyes and the best future keeps snoopy eyes out.
0.99661505	0.84747034	I love this screen protector better than the Zagg protectors.  The best part of this item is no fingerprints at all.  Easy to put on and no glare when viewing the Iphone screen.
0.9992714	0.8724004000000001	I love this brand/product out of all the screen protectors out there. I've tried expensive (Zagg) and low end (shipped from China through eBay), but these are the perfect value in my opinion. The protectors go on so easily and smoothly and bubbles are very easy to smooth out. I would definitely recommend this product.
0.9494780999999999	0.6820215999999999	I liked it so much that I purchased the ipad mini screen protector also.  No bubbles at all!!!  Great screen protector.
0.96809614	0.67396367	I like that it actually works as a screen protector and all the stuff it came with! Defiantly will recommend
0.9422107	0.74827725	Works exactly as intended too! Makes the phone look sleek as well. No longer have annoying people peeking at my business.
0.81354517	0.5808055999999999	Hard to get on without trapping dust\dirt under the cover, but absolutely fantastic when done correctly - can NOT tell that it is even present.
0.5824576	0.5900183000000001	I purchased Tech Armor iPhone 5 Premium High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector as the screen shield as it has worked in the past.  The cover by Incipio Dual PRO for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Cyan Blue / Haze Gray is pretty, and durable, and inexpensive!  It is protective, but not waterproof.  The package may have come with a protective screen, but if it did, I was not impressed.  These 2 companies should work together, both are good!
0.48766962	0.5347274999999999	bought this screen protector for T-mobile's iphone5. Pros: it doesn't affect the quality of the resolution Cons: it doesn't cover the entire screen. I lined it up really well but the size of the screen protector is is a little smaller than the size of the screen. So there's about 1 millimeter of width that isn't protected by the screen protector. Not that big a deal, but because its not exactly the right size, you can see the line where the screen protector ends.
0.97623235	0.6088904	great... just what we were looking for... this was the best price around... there isn't much more to say... not sure why we have to type in so many words
0.9937488999999999	0.8986632999999999	I love the Tech Armor HD screen protector for the iphone 5!  It provides solid scratch protection without clouding up the beautiful retina display.READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY!  There are two tabs that ultimately are used to peel off the protective layers that act as a sandwich to protect the actual HD film during installation.  It is important to start with tab one.  I messed this up by not following the directions, but Tech Armor promptly sent replacements.  Now that is EXCELLENT customer support.By following the instructions, the installation is a snap.  Make sure your phone is perfectly clean.  Not even one dust speck otherwise it will ruin your install.  Just peel back the tab one protector an inch or so, and then line up the film to fit perfectly around the home button.  Take your time doing this since the fit around the home button is really tight.  Make sure the bottom edge is spaced even with the bottom of the face of the phone.  That will allow you to just layout the film without much worry that it will be crooked.  Do not touch any part of the sticky side otherwise you will leave an unsightly fingerprint on the film.  Once its all lined up, start using the squeegee to roll the film down the face of the phone pushing out any air.  The protective layer should be rolling off as you progress.  You don't have to be worried about the squeegee damaging the HD film, since the tab 2 protective layer is peeled off as your last step taking any scratches from installation away with it.  Just make sure you squeegee out any bubbles before you remove the tab 2 protective layer.I messed up the installation at first thinking that the protector film was the actual HD film, but Tech Armor Support bailed me out.  Once I understood that the tabs are numbered, this installation was probably the easiest protective film install that I have done.EXCELLENT product and support!
0.9984787	0.8195251	Would definitely buy this product again, very happy with the quality and outcome. The screen protector attached perfectly to my iphone screen with no bubbles. Just make sure you follow their instructions.
0.999058	0.8649515999999999	Crystal clear screen protector, you can't even tell it's there. Easy to apply, left NO BUBBLES!!!! Excellent Product!!!!! Highly Recommend!!!!
0.44534755	0.6326414	A little difficult to apply and the second adhesive tab leaves a residue on the screen protector. Otherwise, it is crystal clear on the phone.
0.014849573000000001	0.4332932	What you pay is what you get. I paid $6.95 for this screen protector. All the dust that floats around gets attached to this screen protector.I have to clean it 3 times a day. I used a screen protector from AT&T; previously. For $25.00, it was worth the money, no scratches, no accumulating dust and no oily surface. Don't buy it, if it is not free.
0.9988268	0.73268354	Hi, I just got my iPhone 5, and happily I found tech-armor screen protector, my iPhone looks so clear like they said is HD and let me tell you it is, easy to put it on and it look like I don't have a screen protector amazing its just amazing, thank you tech-armor for making such a great products
0.7621682	0.6378066	good qualityi just wished that there were more in the pack.it came quickly and it includes a wiper and a thingy that removes bubblesfits my brand new iphone perfectlyi will be repurchasing
0.9857792	0.6371011999999999	Good product, with a good price.  I would recommend watching the video before installing it can be a little tricky.
0.27116358	0.78877556	For those who are expecting some kind of magic, 10 viewing angle, sorry. This isn't the screen for you, do let me know if you find such a thing.I do not see any kind of cross hatching when I look at the screen. But, I did notice that the screen is much scratchier, about as annoying as the clack that sometimes happens when your fingernail hits the screen.Now, to break down what you can see by degrees:* A normal screen (without this screen protector) is visible at about 90 degrees to the side, left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Someone standing way off to your side can still make out what's on your screen, depending on how your phone is facing.* With this screen protector, people more than 60 degrees from perpendicular are unable to see anything.* Between 45 and 60 degrees, you can barely make out the outlines of the screen, as if the backlight were turned off. It's much harder if you're in a bright, outdoor area, since the screen protector will reflect light at those angles.* There is normal visibility up to about 45 degrees out. Depending on how you hold your phone, people sitting next to you may not be able to see your screen, but people behind you probably will.
0.9972671000000001	0.7465928000000001	Fits perfect and easy to install. Good instructions to install. Will recommend. Comes in pack of 3. Each sheet has to be fixed both sides.
0.9122405000000001	0.7131394	Instructions are a bit tricky and ended up with a small air bubble at the bottom. Overall through, it's doing the job and protecting my phone.
0.95753115	0.8552164000000001	I had previously been using the cheapo 3 for 99 cent Chinese protectors, but these are a dramatic improvement.  Once it's on, you wouldn't know there was anything covering your glass if you didn't know better.  Bubbles are pressed out easily during install, and best of all my finger glides effortlessly over this protector the same as it does over the glass (as opposed to the cheapo protectors, where there was a clear resistance when you dragged your finger).  Also it's much less prone to smudges and fingerprints, and wipes off easily.Hint:  Heat up your shower and install in the steamy bathroom.  You'll have much less dust and lint in the air during your installation.Note that these protectors do not go 100% to the edge of the screen, but none of them do for this phone.  It's inherent in the design.  But most phone cases wrap over onto the screen a tiny bit and will protect the small area not covered by this protector.
0.29047784	0.51295716	I like that its anti-glare. But I'm not a fan of the matte finish because it takes away from the graphics of the iPhone.
0.15359762	0.39381105	When applying the protector I found that this screen protector was somewhat smaller than I expected. Not by much, but it cover didn't reach all sides of the phone.
0.5537959	0.60076356	I had originally ordered the Skinomi screen protectors for my new iPhone5.  Those turned out to be a disaster.  I didn't like the fact that the Skinomi ones required you to pretty much wet the device and let it sit for 12-24 hours after applying.  Even after the wait, the Skinomi skin still looked like it wasn't completely dry (you could see an orange peel effect on the phone).  After reading reviews for the Tech Armor skins, I decided to order the 3pk in case I messed up applying the others.  Packaging was simple, directions were straight forward.  I was able to apply the skin in one try.  No hassle, no wetting the phone, and no waiting.  The process took me less than 3 minutes.  Would definitely order again.  Just wished the provided screens for the back of the phone now.  For now, I'm stuck with the thick and crappy Skinomi protector for the back.
0.989424	0.84014785	Easy to install, protects my phone well, did not change sensitivity of touch screen on my phone -- what more can a person ask for from a screen protector?
0.9932517	0.7221571	Just follow the instructions & watch the video for perfect installation. I've used other brands before this is the first to really work.
0.9890892	0.83821595	product works great, it's very clear, and it doesn't feel any different than the actual screen to me. definitely worth the money.
0.6784866	0.7568704	Item came as described + on time. I was a little hesitant to pay the $7 price which was a little steep in comparison to other screen protectors since it's almost $2 a protector. While the product itself seems good, there are some installation issues which as small as they may be, prevent me from giving the product the full five stars. I ended up using all 3 screen protectors for one installation, so I pretty much paid $7 for a single screen protector. Even at that, the third protector wasn't installed perfectly. I think the product would be a lot better if you applied the film from the top of the iPhone rather than the bottom so you could use the camera and the speaker to align the sticker rather than the circular home screen. I wasted one of the screen protectors from trying to align it so many times because the product is so clear. Tech Armor, if you are reading this, please make one of the removable films slightly colored and see through just so we could align it easier while being able to see the bubbles. The last issue I had on the third and final screen protector was removing the bubbles. I used the provided card to smooth out the protector, and it caused a &#34;smear&#34; on the underside of the screen protector from the sticky part. All in all, it's a good product based on user error.
0.99781823	0.8641139999999999	I love the feel of this screen cover.  It has the matte finish instead of the glossy finish which shows fingerprints easier.  Glad I bought this one.
0.8761805	0.68418807	With the instructions in the mail, I was able to install the protector and get rid of the bubbles in less than 2 minutes. The third extra layer makes life so much easier. I like this product.
0.9417162	0.73336923	This is a great product. It doesn't feel like I have a screen protector. Very easy to install. There were 0 air bubbles. Got it right in 1 try.
0.9976865	0.8721365	I bought both the anti-glare and the HD Clear version of these screen protectors. I decided to try the HD Clear version first. In the past, I have tried screen protectors and they have been hard to install. This one was so easy to install and it lets the Retina display of my iPhone 5 shine through. Plus, I don't feel any difference when using the touch screen. I would highly recommend.
0.9968925999999999	0.8869196	I have Tech Armor protectors installed on an Iphone, an Ipad and a Kindle Fire HD. The installations were all flawless and the protector works great.  There is no issue with touch control, either with a finger or stylus.  It does cut down on fingerprints and glare, and no issues with using a case on the products.
0.8127177	0.6098696	Very good product was delivered when it say it was going to be and so easy to put on  if you do not glare from the light on your phone get this product 5 thumbs up
0.5130483	0.6001102	Installed my first try.  There were a couple of small bubbles that I was able to quickly remove by pushing them toward the edge.  The screen looks pretty clear but not as good as just the glass screen with no screen protector.
0.48276	0.4157014	It works good but i could not get the bubbles out but there were very little so it was ok.but thanks
0.9847091	0.7259781	These protectors do a great job. The hd is true and they are super easy to install. The only complaint i have is u are going to have to wipe them down often due to how well they show your finger prints. They also are not anti glare. I enjoy them though. Plus u get 3 of the for 7 bucks. Try finding that at best buy
0.9549203000000002	0.78406703	I have never used an adhesive screen protector (SP) before but because I could not get a good seal with my new Otterbox Defender I opted to remove its integral SP and replace it with Tech Armor Anti-Glare.  I couldn't be happier with the results, but it took me three attempts to get it perfect. You cannot cheat on the instruction to get the desired results. Any slight dust will blotch/bubble the screen.  Follow the instructions; take your time and you will get what's advertised.  The matte finish does not show fingerprints, there is no glare and the touch sensory pick up is spot on.  Excellent product!
0.99678683	0.79813945	This screen protector worked great.  It is very important to follow the instructions, especially in preparing and thoroughly cleaning the surface.  I found that the cut-outs and alignments for the iPhone5 were quite accurate.  Great value for the $.
0.9657891	0.7897522	The Tech Armor screen protector went on with no trouble.  The screen is now much clearer, compared to the last brand protector I used.  I would recommend this others.
0.9555875	0.7505129	This is a good screen shield, it goes on pretty and the anti-glare works really well in the bright sunlight. I would recommend.
0.99561	0.7073351	I will definitely recommend this product. I like the way it was easy to apply and noooo bubbles! Great product.
0.9983521999999999	0.76802945	Awesome privacy screen at an even better price. Way better than any competitors and awesome customer service. Definitely would recommend to a friend!
0.9078076999999999	0.69947505	They are clear, stick well, and no bubbles! What more can you ask for? Just make sure the phone screen is clean before trying to install!
0.48857462	0.6372140000000001	These screen protectors are really good. Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I had to waste 2 of the screen protectors before I could actually place correctly on phone. If you have air bubbles when you put the screen on your phone; this product come with a cardboard logo thingy that you can use to press on the screen to rid the bubble. So far I had the screen on my phone for about a week and I can happily say the screen still looks pretty clean. If your looking for some screens give Tech Armor HD a shot. I'll probably buy another set once the one on my phone starts losing its shiny appeal.
0.9096552	0.5917783000000001	I bought these protectors to go on my new iphone 5, and I am a big fan so far. I really like how the pack came with a sticky, dust-remover strip to clean off the screen after wiping with the cloth. It really did help get all the tiny things off before I put on the protector. I do wish it came with one strip for each protector, as it likely won't be as useful when I have to put a new one one. But so far, so good!
0.95319325	0.7164014	This is a great product at a reasonable price, I ended up buying a second one for another phone I use.
0.028859287999999997	0.39877188	Got the three pack of screen protectors. I had nothing but problems. All three screens had parts that would not stick to the phone, one time it was this corner the next it was that corner. I would not recommend this screen protector.
0.9559040999999999	0.7603661	Best screen protector ever. Not only keeps people away from looking, but also protects my screen pretty good. :D :D
0.97909474	0.5862670999999999	It's good for my iPhone 5 it protect and looks good. So, I recommend it, the good thing is that it matches my screen very good
0.99089205	0.7712078	As soon as I got this I put it on with out instructions it was easy then it works great no problems so far
0.8796965	0.77016306	This is by far the best screen protector I have used on any of my phones! I had no bubbles and absolutely no trouble putting this on (got it on the first try)..and I usually have awful luck with both of those two things. In addition to the matted look, which I wasn't certain if I would like or not..and btw I absolutely do...I was skeptical about it being anti-fingerprint. Folks if you're looking for an anti-fingerprint screen protector, this is the one. I'm sold--from now on I'll buy all my screen protectors from Tech Armor.
0.991181	0.7496898	Good instructions, easy to install.  Did not notice any glare or reduced clarity.  Would highly recommend and would purchase again.
0.9951223	0.76265615	Excellent ...Awesome . No bubbles. Awesome . No bubblesAwesome . No bubblesAwesome . No bubblesAwesome . No bubblesAwesome . No bubblesAwesome . No bubbles
0.24411285	0.6801863	The only problem I have is more of an OCD nitpick. The top portion of the cutout was off by about 2 millimeters to the left (wasn't centered), but it was cut in such a way that it doesn't block the camera or speaker.  Again, more of an OCD thing but a little bit annoying.It is also not in the T shape as seen in the screenshot (to allow for mis-alignment of the cut they widened the top part - the camera hole).Other than that, all good.
0.94656444	0.7609583000000001	This is a wonderful product!! First, I was unsuccessful applying it to the phone's screen: the instructions seemed complicated and there were bubbles under the screen protector. However, I contacted their customer service via e-mail and they sent me a new package of two sets of protective layers in less than a week. Upon receiving it, I managed to install it without any troubles. The customer service agent was super nice, the product works perfectly, so overall I'm more than satisfied with Tech Armor. I definitely recommend it!(If you just consider the price factor: my phone carrier offered me the same screen protector, but it would have cost me $35 instead of $7...)
0.9972475000000001	0.8532921999999998	Perfect screen protectors.  Great video on their website for demonstration of how best to install.  Went on perfectly and 1st try.  The cutouts for the camera and speaker are off center but not really noticeable.  Very happy with these and exactly described after a few day use.
0.8905818000000001	0.74101824	I had a fight with this thing trying to get all the bubbles out. I ended up turning it over to a friend and leaving the room while he applied it, but he managed to do it perfectly, so maybe it's just me! I use this with a Rearth matte black slim case and love how the matte screen looks! No loss of functionality at all. Have had this on for a little over a month and there are 2 small &#34;pin pricks&#34; in it now, probably from my keys when I put it in my purse. Glad they send you three because I'm sure I'll have to replace it in the next year. I would recommend this product.
0.98257554	0.78147304	These were the easiest screen protectors to put on. We watched the video a few times and proceeded to put it on two Iphone 5's. No air bubbles. I have had them on for a five days and I have no complaints. I would buy again
0.93852234	0.86025774	This screen protector is fantastic.  The matte finish makes it easy to see even in the sun; still tough to see when it's super bright direct sunlight, but the point is it is anti-glare exactly as described.I have not left a single print mark on my screen since I put this on.  I've had the same screen in place for almost two months without it so much as peeling up a corner.They include a cloth, tape and smoothing board in the package along with the three screens.  I suggest using the tape even if you think it looks perfect already.  I noticed some very tiny particles got stuck underneath the screen when I first applied even though I thought I had it perfectly clear.
0.99795175	0.8348179	These screen protectors are the best ones I've used so far! They come with a complete set of instructions and the tools necessary to get a good result each time. Very good quality for a very affordable price. I'd recommend these to anyone who needs an iphone 5 screen protector.
0.22697511	0.5886245	So, don't waste your money on these.  I have bought them before and was satisfied, but the seller has changed the product.  Cheaper material, and it used to have protective covers on both sides of screen protector.  The remaining protective cover is backwards, so that you have to align everything the hard way, using only the hole for the button, rather than the much easier two holes for the ear piece and microphone.  Finally, people should know this seller does everything it can to avoid negative feedback on the site by including a handout with each product that says call us first before you post feedback.  Sketchy.  Sellers should rise or fall with the quality of their products, not whether they can bribe/payoff disgruntled buyers!
0.9947287	0.7529988000000001	I love this screen protector. Highly recommend this product. My product was missing one screen protector. Called the company and they immediately mailed me another three set. Got it within days. Excellent customer service. You won't go wrong with this company.

0.9958315000000001	0.8664601000000001	I've tried many screen protectors before, weather Griffin, Ozacki and no-brand protectors, this is the best by far, real anti-glare , no fingerprints at all , very easy to install without bubble.
0.095015556	0.38867372	"I guess you either have ""it"" or you don't.  In spite of watching the Youtube installation video first, cleaning the screen in accordance with the directions, I went through all three of the screens in the packet, had more bubbles than clear space with all of them, plus the ""Remove Me!"" stickers all left glue on the protector, even if I had installed them successfully, which I didn't.  Wasn't meant to be, I guess."
0.9753194	0.83487433	I've very happy with this cover. It was very easy to put on. No wet solution to put on, just cleaning off the screen and then slowly putting it on and making sure no dust or hairs are still under it. It has protected the screen well and I've had no problems with it staying on either
0.99899846	0.8440969000000001	Great product at a great price. The instructions were clear and the application was very easy. I am very glad I made this purchase and would purchase from this buyer again.
0.99559265	0.66584027	Good product. Easy to apply and adequately protects screen. Can't beat the price. I would recommend to others. Not the best application tool, but who really cares?
0.9851947	0.8570119	Nice quality screen protectors, easy to install. Messed up on the first one but second one went on smoothly with no bubbles at all. The HD ones do show fingerprints and smudges but that's to be expected and these protectors do not affect the display at all. Would definitely recommend.
0.96734667	0.85762507	Easy to apply, fits perfectly, looks awesome, feels awesome, no glare, and my clammy hand smudges wipe off with no problem. :)To apply screen covers like this one, what I do is:1. Rinse it off first. Peel the applicator thingy off and just rinse it off. It doesn't take the stick away, I promise. Shake off excess water, but it's okay to still have water drops on it. The tiny bit of water won't get into your phone.2. Apply it. Line up the top or the bottom or the side or whatever part you want to apply first. Then press the rest of it down.3. Get the bubbles out. There will be bubbles. Get a credit card and press the bubbles out. The water makes this easy. You can put a rag or something on the edge so that the water doesn't drip everywhere when you press it out. (Try not to wipe TOWARDS your speaker or your Home button though. Wipe towards the sides of your phone.) The big bubbles will go away.4. Let it dry. Any tiny bubbles should go away on their own as the rest of the water under the screen cover dries. This could take up to a few days, just ignore them.5. Voila! Perfectly-applied screen cover with no dust marks, pet hair, or bubbles.I do this every time. I have dogs, so I always have dust or dog hair or something on the screen cover right when I take it out of the package, and those dog hairs or dust particles cause bubbles. Rinsing it off first prevents this. :)I hope this helps someone!
0.9976883	0.77563703	I think this is a very good value product. Works perfectly. Does its job. I was impressed that I actually had no bubbles- it was first time that perfect done by myself. I recommend.
0.9778589	0.81824344	I'm extremely impressed with this product. It was easy to install and is fitting well. You loose a little sensitivity on the screen, but that is with any protector. I bought these for both my iPad and iPhone, and would do it again!
0.98563397	0.8389485999999999	Tech Armor screen protectors are great!  Once it is on you don't even notice it is there.  They seemed much easier to apply than other ones I have had in the past.  However, I did use all 3 to finally get one that had no bubbles or lint.  But I always have problems with bubbles no matter what protectors I use!  I was just glad the third one was the charm!  I definitely would purchase again.
0.09434762599999999	0.51572466	The product does what it says: protects the screen from scratches and creates a completely matte and glare-free surface. However, due to it being matte, it sort of ruins the screen quality of the phone. Things don't look as crisp and detailed.
0.9837164	0.8432853000000001	I have an iPhone 5 through work.  They sent me Verizon brand screen protectors.  They were okay but didn't cover the whole screen.  I had  Tech Armor (anti-fingerprint) on my iPhone 4 and liked them so I decided to get these in HD clear.I'm glad I went with them, especially the HD crystal clear.  I was able to easily apply with no bubbles and they are VERY clear.  I'm sure I'll have to deal with fingerprints, but it's all a trade off.If you want a very reasonably priced clear screen protector, I would FOR SURE buy this!
0.9933791	0.8775318999999999	"The tech armor was easy to apply.  However, I would recommend a few improvements to the instructions.  The #1 and #2 on the ""remove me"" labels were so small that I had to look really hard to tell which was which.  For the benefit of those without perfect vision, I would recommend the instructions be in larger print as well.Definitely watch the video before applying the tech armor.  There are also written directions in larger print if you scroll down from the video.  The dust removal tape wasn't mentioned in the video, so I wasn't sure exactly what it was or what to do with it.  I probably could have done a better job with that since I did end up with a tiny piece of fuzz under the tech armor. If you find bubbles under the 2nd label once you take it off, be sure to wrap the cloth around the card before trying to push them out.The ipod works great with it on... I see no difference in the sensitivity of the screen even when it's in the arm band case I use for exercising that has an additional plastic covering."
0.982031	0.6565151	I love the idea that I know my i-phone 5 is safely in a protected case.. Also, love the color of the case..
0.99345934	0.7597288000000001	It works as it's supposed to! Easy to put on. I only had about 2 tiny bubbles. I love this brand and always get these for my devices.
0.9969021	0.87070113	These screen protectors are fantastic. They were incredibly easy to apply to my phone. They arrived in a nice little package along with simple, clear instructions, a cloth for cleaning, a &#34;squeegee&#34; tool for getting out the bubbles, and even some tape to get off the last bits of dust. I'd read about the trick of using tape, but I love that they send it.
0.9695826999999999	0.41857730000000004	I bought this for my son's Iphone 5.  Being 18, he thinks everyone is watching him and wanted me to get this for him.  After applying it, the product really works.  We tested it from all angles and now when he is in school, he doesn't have to worry about someone looking over his shoulder trying to see what he is doing.  I really he think he wanted because I am always trying to see what he is up to!
0.30904034	0.5519177	After I fixed it to the screen, observed that the sensitivity on the screen is lost. I have to push hard to press a button or to do a slide. Removed it.
0.8882013000000001	0.7927920999999999	I like the clear screen protector.  It was an easy install and fit very well on the phone.  The only issue is that the cutout for the camera is off center slightly, it just fit.
0.9929875	0.8095	the best protectors i have ever used.  no bubbles, goes on very easy, again NO bubbles.  will buy again !!!!
0.07548255	0.5291011	This material feels like fake glass. I dropped it once and it has scratches like the ones in plastic screen protectors. Disappointed
0.80097413	0.7264695999999999	Protection from peering eyes and psycho earrings. Last time I let someone borrow my phone to make a call I noticed her earring left a mark on my tech armor. This certainly would have scratched my screen. The impression on the tech armor has since gone away. Perfect screen protection.
0.38009098	0.4931214	I received the protectors and they would not stick to the phone so I purchased an Otter Box phone protector and they work well.  I did notify the company about the problem and I received a return e-mail saying they would replace the defective protectors.  I replied that I did not need the protectors now but they did sent replacements anyway.  An example of a company going out of their way for customer satisfaction. I would highly recommend this company to everyone!!!
0.48433083	0.46691750000000004	The quality of their product is superb.It's just what i wanted on my Iphone 5.I had difficulty putting on the screen protector-- not because of the product itself, but I am just not deft enough.After using up all three packs without much success, I sent an email to the company in desperation.In response, they sent an additional--more detailed-- instruction of how to apply the screen protector on the iPhone and an guarantee of another 3-pack of the screen protector (FREE OF CHARGE!)Thank you, Tech Armor.  Your customer service is notable and is the epitome of how all vendors should treat their customers.
0.6859022	0.6318191	It's looks good easy to install and also gave step by step guideline. I'm giving 4 stars because while using with clean hand, finger printed on the screen and looks dirty.
0.90554804	0.78606856	I like this screen guard. It installed easily on the iPhone 5 and I was even able to remove a dust spec that snuck in during application. I have owned an anti-glare screen for my iPhone 4 and knew the difference it makes in the viewing of the screen. I took a star off as the cuts seem slightly (and I mean only slightly) off.I would definitely recommend this screen guard.
0.85893303	0.61425453	I love this screen protector. I used all three trying to get it on, but when it's on, you don't even realize it's there! I only gave 4 stars because there is a little part at the top that looks like a bubble, but just didn't stick. I'm sure it was my fault though. I'd definitely recommend this, especially because it is such a low price!
0.9375155000000001	0.6888435	I already have these thech armos anti-fingerprint on my ipad and they are excelent. I recomend them to everyone. They are very good quality products.
0.38790733	0.6504661	It's what you'd expect...took me two tries to get it on without bubbles as the screen cleaner supplied didn't work quite as well as you'd hope.
0.9244385	0.82102585	While putting on the screen protector was pretty straight forward (which was what I was really worried about after reading all the reviews about the difficulty of getting rid of bubbles, etc.), the screen protector diminishes the clarity and the quality of images significantly. It's especially noticeable in lighter colors. I can see all the red green blue pixels... I think it also slightly diminishes the sensitivity of touch, which is not so noticeable when you're just typing but definitely when i'm playing games that require quick movements. Even though I like the soft feel on my screen, I will definitely get one of the crystal clear protectors next time.
0.9820258	0.8221195	I've had my phone for the past 5 months and the same screen protector for just about as long. Applying it was actually far easier than I expected. I'm usually very terrible with putting screen protectors on. Even though I still did mess up a little, it comes with a nice little smoother so you can get rid of excess bubbles.It does a very fantastic job at covering my screen.
0.9821126	0.8457063	I must admit that I ended up ruining the first screen protector from not lining it up correctly with the screen. Because of that, I tried to readjust it, only to get my finger caught on the adhesive side and ruining it. I did get the second one to line up correctly, but it did take some time to get a couple of the bubbles to disappear. Out of frustration, I ended up calling Tech Armor's customer service. I called after-hours, but did leave a message expressing the difficulty I had with the screen protectors. To my surprise, less than an hour later, I got a call from Eric at Tech Armor. After discussing my experience on the difficulty I had with the screen protector, he said he'd send a new package to me, including some tips to apply the screen protector. Talk about great customer service! He empathized with me and said that for many people, it does take one or two screen protectors before they can successfully apply it. No question that it does take some preparation and patience to apply these screen protectors correctly. My recommendation is to visit their website, read the directions, and then play and study the instructional video. Also, make sure you're in a well-lit area so that you can see what you're doing. Like I said, it did take some time to get a couple of the small bubbles to disappear. Once I did get rid of them, the screen protector looked great and still looks great.
0.9713556999999999	0.7333713000000001	Definitely watch the video on how to put them on, I got mine on perfectly with no bubbles on the first try!I've had mine on for over 3 months and haven't changed it yet.
0.98150265	0.7840309	The screen protector went on very smooth. I did watch the video before hand just to make sure I was doing it correctly. Very few bubbles and was a perfect fit.
0.9983905999999999	0.8134236	After reading the reviews some great and not so great. Thought I would give it a try for my iphone 5s.  And so glad I did.  This has to be one of the best screen protectors I have ever bought.  I love the little screen cleaner then the dust stickers was just a bonus to help.  I peeled the protector off and it was very easy to get on the phone you just have to take you time and line it up correctly and try not to breath lol I had a little bubble but used the other little tool include to get the bubbles out worked perfectly then took off the last protector and it looked like I had nothing on it, so clear and clean.  Awesome protector! Very happy with my purchase.
0.8302455	0.81655943	Original: I ordered this protective cover for my iPhone, and, when I received the package, the cutouts for the camera and speaker were not the elongated cutouts. Therefore, the cutouts cover up the sensors next to the speaker and camera. :(Edited: After I posted my initial review, I was contacted by customer service, which informed me that the cutouts are just fine for the screen protector. The proximity sensor is covered on my iPhone, but it still works perfectly when I am making calls! The screen protector is beautiful and does not cover the brightness of my screen. My screen looks HD, and people cannot even tell that I have a screen protector on my phone (except for the place where my case has pushed up the screen protector, and it has become loose). Overall, I would recommend this protector and think that it is a great value (especially for the price!).
0.9990959	0.80878854	Love this screen protector. Easy to apply, can't really tell its there, and it looks great. Plus it doesn't leave your prints behind, gotta love a protector that stays clear!!!
0.98841655	0.8325333	This is the best screen protectors I have found! It is easy to put on and it lasted must longer than any other screen protectors I have tried.
0.9761048000000001	0.6721498	This is the perfect finishing touch to your iPhone!  It's a little tricky to get on but the direction which are included guide you step by step & when you are done you will not believe you ever did without it.I love the anti-glare factor!
0.99923396	0.74107707	Easy to use, great directions, great price. Fits my iphone 5 perfect couldnt be happier with this purchase will order a couple for back up.
0.8607519	0.695155	The instructions were very helpful in putting on the screen protector. I usually buy 2-3 at a time because I mess up the first one, but I got this one on with no problem! I really liked the dust tape that helped me get it on without tiny pieces of dust making a bubble. I now have 2 screen protectors to spare. yay!
0.10935116	0.59774995	Tried to put these on my iPhone, they went on just fine. Until I had to remove the little sticker that helps you place the cover on your phone( the sticker says 'remove me'). That little sticker left its stick on the screen protector! So the top of my screen at the bottom corner was all sticky. I tried again, super carefully to remove the little sticker from another one and the same thing happened.So I gave up and returned them. With the sticky on the protective screen it would have attracted dirt and fuzz to stick to the front of the phone.
0.99619967	0.82519096	This is probably the nicest and easiest applications for a screen protected I've ever seen. I would recommend this to a friend.
0.0013244151999999999	0.5422204	I was extremely disappointed after receiving these screen protectors.  There are 3 protectors and none of them had the appropriate stickers for removal, I wasted all 3 trying to separate them.  Poor quality and a waste of money!
0.25535238	0.37107348	I think if I could have lined it up I would have done better but could not blame the product. Thin, clear and tough. For some reason I just could not get it on properly
0.37824306	0.652213	I was able to get the screen protector onto my iPhone within 15 minutes without air bubbles. The instructions were extremely clear, and people can hardly tell I even have a screen protector on. It doesn't result in loss of the retina display quality, and if fingerprints manage to get on your screen, Tech Armor even provided a cleaning cloth.
0.84930634	0.80459976	I like the end result of the Tech Armor HD Screen Protector--it doesn't take away from screen sensitivity and is easy to clean, plus the obvious added bonus of protecting your screen. The problem is that it is hard to put on without the fibers from the screen cleaning cloth getting underneath the adhesive of the screen protector. I had to trash my first one completely because it got too messed up with the fibers from the cleaning cloth. The ways that this product could be improved is with having a higher quality cloth that doesn't get tiny fibers everywhere, and with making an easier application process. I got my screen protector on with the second of the three they give you. Overall, I like this product and would recommend it to people. Just be sure to have enough time to make mistakes when you're trying to put this on--don't rush yourself with this process. You want to get it right the first time.
0.8656275	0.23143521	Buen producto !!!! Excelente precio !!!! El tiempo de entrega fue el acordado dentro de USA, los env&iacute;os a CentroAmerica deber&iacute;an hacerse m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido.
0.8598268	0.75488055	love it ! have had it for a little while now it is a true privacy screen when people try to look over they see absolutely nothing !
0.98536354	0.7304633	I ordered the screen protector on April 17th. I got it today, April 22nd! They said that the estimated delivery date was between April 23rd to April 26th. I got it earlier than expected! Tech Armor company values their customer's complete satisfaction!At first, the process in applying the screen protector onto my iPhone 5 was a little difficult, but it was worth it. Just make sure you take your time and do not rush! It's honestly easy to put on! They included a tape that can be used to remove the dust particles! Good thinking! I also read that if you're not 100% satisfied, they allow you to return the product OR they will send you another 3-pack for free! How awesome is that?! I say a good deal in a Lifetime Warranty! Win/win situation! Well, I'll be sure to purchase more of their product if needed!The screen protector really is HD! Yes, HIGH DEFINITION! I noticed this because my last screen protector wasn't as clear! The Otterbox screen protector that came with the case is weak compared to Tech Armor's HD screen protector!Good job Tech Armor!Your valuable customer,H
0.9910029	0.6424819	I was very pleased with the Tech Armor protector.  The website has good instructions on how to apply it.  The company seemed very interested in making sure I'm satisfied.
0.9924263000000001	0.6283325	Perfect screen protector that I bought, easy to install, good qualify, I give 5 start on this product......I love it
0.97061557	0.7505358	I already had this product but wanted some new ones to replace current sheet that got scratch b/c I placed the phone in my purse with sharp objects. It protected the screen so I am pretty happy.
0.98506474	0.81037384	Quick and easy to install. Had the ZAGG Invisible Shield, which was to thick,  not cut well, only came with one shield and was around $20. Tech Armor was delivered fast and was way better value for the price. Comes with three shields.
0.9760337	0.74121594	Awesome screen protectors super easy to put on and the costumer service is amazing!!!! I bought 2 packs of screen protector for the whole family and it fit perfectly but for some reason my started to peel near the camera area but they quickly offer to give me 2 whole new packs of screens protector and even offer a diff product for me to try out for being a loyal customer. Will definitely buy more stuff from them!!
0.9504950999999999	0.7197815	I like this screen protector better than any other kinds.The feel is good and the quality overall of the phone is better.
0.99685335	0.6897555000000001	Received this tech armor for my new iphone 5.  Fast delivery, easy to install.  Enjoyed the demo video on tech's website.  Thanks.
0.9973940999999998	0.9121914000000001	Great screen protector. Fits pretty much perfect.  The squeegee works well enough, albeit a credit card or ID can also be used. Make sure to wipe with the included microfiber cloth prior to applying.My only gripe is that the home button is a cutout (upside down U) instead of an actual circle.  Other than that, the screen protector lines up perfectly with the front camera and speaker holes.One thing to note about anti glare vs clear screen protectors is that anti glare has a matte finish so it does wash out the colors (barely noticeable).  However, the advantage of it (as the name implies) is that your phone can be used under sunlight and does not show fingerprints.  Also from my experience, anti glare is much easier to put on compared to the clear ones.Here are some tips if you have trouble putting on screen protectors1. Wash hands thoroughly2. KEEP FACEDOWN and peel the whole applicator off while only touching the sides.2a. Refrain from touching the sticky side of the screen protector.3. It's easier to use the speaker and camera as reference, not the home button (IMO).4. Use scotch tape to lift screen protector and safely take out air bubbles (youtube has videos on this).5. If still having trouble with dust going in, go in the bathroom and turn on the hot water.  The steam will bring particles down allowing for a dust-free environment.I usually waste 1-2 screen protectors before having a perfect one on but now it takes me just one.
0.9574848	0.77596045	Exactly as described.  Directions included on how to apply to the screen with minimal issues.  I have a bubble down where the opening is, but not anywhere on the &#34;screen&#34; so it is no big deal.  Really gives a matte look and does not leave grease/smudge marks as easily as other covers.
0.17187524	0.5293273000000001	Its ok to install. Definitely is what you pay for, if you have damp hands or something it blotches the screen and has a rainbow effect.
0.9994066999999999	0.8564367	These protectors are pretty sweet. They protect my screen, and they look really good on the phone. I use them in conjunction with the Tech Armor frosted case for iPhone 5 and they are a perfect match. One of the better case combinations out there for those of us looking for a minimalist option. Also, the customer service by Tech Armor is outstanding. I had a question relating to the application of the case and they responded with a timely, well worded, and personalized response. Great company to deal with.I would definitely buy these again.
0.67525303	0.71502775	I like the way it feels on the screen. It does its job, it takes about 15 minutes to place on your phone because it has to be placed in the correct angle so that the buttons or camera isn't covered.No finger prints on my screen!
0.97743535	0.76681644	Pretty good and value for money. I definitely recommend this product to every one. I looked at other similar products on other sites and even on Amazon but this seemed just perfect and I was not wrong.
0.24777648	0.44506443	I am not happy with this screen protector. First, it was not easy to install. But the most annoying thing is that it is very sticky. Because of that, it leaves finger prints, other marks and dust on it. I have to continuously clean it. I think I have paid too much $$ for the quality of these screen protectors.
0.16095972	0.4739465	There are three protectors in the pack so when I got the first one covered in dust I threw it out and had two more tries to go. Seriously, do I need to live in a clean room to do this sort of thing?
0.9823011999999999	0.7934416999999999	it is a great matte material that gives me the piece of mind when shoving keys and change in the same picket as my phone.  You must line it up exactly and make sure there is NO dust on the screen or the little dust molecules will appear as air bubbles.  otherwise, a great product.
0.9346429	0.6286505	The product is really good it does what it claims it will do.  More important the company stands behind their product and their warranty is excellent.  Simply you can't go wrong
0.99180305	0.82164395	I like this protector, quality is good,you will get 3 protectors, no bubbles ifproperly installed and comes with some installation materials like lint,Squeegee,sticker for dust removal and installation guide, recommend this product
0.9985427	0.8413881999999999	Great product -- use the tape trick (see on youtube) and install is a breeze -- no bubbles!!  Fits iPhone 5 perfectly.
0.97038823	0.6874267	received it on time and it looks good. hopefully it'll protect my ipad for longer time. thanks Tech Armor for a nice product.
0.9998800999999999	0.80678606	Very pleased with this purchase. Easy to apply and excellent quality! I will highly recommend to friends and colleagues. Keep up the great service!
0.3774532	0.62123924	If you follow the directions, this was SO easy to put on.  I had hardly ANY bubbles, and the ones I did have (I only had 3) were at most 2mm in diameter and on the edges already so it was nothing to push them out with the &#34;squeegee&#34; provided.  The &#34;squeegee&#34; provided is actually just a small, hard, piece of stiff paper with their logo on it.  I almost thought it was a sticker until I realized it wouldn't bend.  The one peculiarity was that while I was putting it on, as I got to the top where the earpiece and the camera are, it looked as if I was putting it on crookedly since the opening on the screen protector was way off.  I tried to start over again but realized I had had it straight the whole time.  I was disappointed until I put the whole thing on, and although it fits and the screen protector does NOT cover any part of the earpiece OR camera (phewf), each of those &#34;cut-outs&#34; on the screen protector are too large, which I guess they did to compensate for changes in the iPhone?  I don't know, but it fits, it was easy to &#34;install&#34; and it seems like it will protect my phone, which is all I ask for in the end.  So, thank you!
0.81119907	0.8091785	This screen protector was very easy to install by following the included instructions and is very clear (i.e invisible when clean).  My single issue with it is that I think the cost of the glossy surface is that it really picks up oils from my fingers dramatically making the surface appear smudgy (when the screen is blank).  I do not have particularly oily skin.  When the phone is on these smudges are not visible and they do come off with a little mild soapy-water mixture.  That said, my wife has a protector (not sure what brand) that has a slightly matte finish and she does not have this problem.  In defense of the Tech Armor, my wife's screen is ever so slightly less bright due to the matte finish.  So I guess you need to decide what tradeoff you prefer to make.  Shiny protector shows prints whereas a matte protector appears not to.  Nice touch, as well, that this protect comes with three (3) protectors in the box.  Definitely a good value.
0.3698681	0.62339604	This is a pain to put on, could not get all the dirt off my screen. Fingerprints were all over the place and putting my face to the phone to make a call made the screen sticky. A lot of the dirt on the screen protector would eventually not want to come off. Now I use the SPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Glass Slim [GLAS.tR SLIM] and it works wonderfully. It does cost more, but it is more permanent, has little fingerprints, and is harder than the cheap plastic material used on Tech Armor's. screen protectors; it is made of real glass instead.
0.98845065	0.8373152	These screen protectors went on without a hitch. I would buy from Tech Armor again and recommend this company to others.
0.070949644	0.3401606	I read all of the positive reviews on here before I purchased the Tech Armor anti-glare screen protector. I purchased it about a month ago, waiting & hoping that I'd get used to it before I posted a review. Unfortunately, I do not care for it. I didn't have any problem putting it on, but it really dulls the screen. The screen is not sharp at all. I wanted to get anti-glare as I prefer this style screen protector, and have it on other types of devices (ipod touch & nook) and haven't had problems with them. I thought I'd try Tech Armor since I paid a lot of money for my other ones, but now I'm sorry I did.  I guess you get what you pay for.**UPDATE: Tech Armor contacted me immediately saying they would replace the antiglare screen for the regular screen protector. However, two months later, I am still waiting! I have contacted Tech Armor twice, and both times they have said that I will recieve it within 10 days. I have yet to recieve anything!!***FINALLY, I have received my HD screen protectors! The screen looks significantly better!
0.6661592	0.5873565	I had a hard time putting it on my phone screen, but maybe that was just me. It definitely protects it very well though.
0.9827205	0.6903289	I read the reviews before I purchased this item.  Make sure you screen is free of lint and this goes on perfect!
0.8352946	0.7919031999999999	This screen protector is high quality and has a great feel. It was easy to put on as well with minimal bubbling. For the most part it has not affected the responsiveness of my touch screen, though it has had its moments. The quality of the screen graphics is diminished somewhat, however. Overall a great product.
0.7065986999999999	0.7415385	Had 2 screen protectors that came with cases and both of these were easy to scratch and apply...The Tech Armor one went on much better and liked the fact that it had a cutout for the home slot rather than a continuous opening all the way to the bottom of the protector like many of the other products out there so as a result the fit is much more precise than other ones I've seen which means there's no seams or bubbles on the sides or top/bottom for dirt to start getting into
0.19859949	0.46784204	The screen is very clear and it doesn't hinder any of the touch-screen functionality.However, I wasted two screens during the application process. 80% user error, 10% over-active AC vent blowing dust onto my screen, and 10% microscopic font depicting step-by-step instructions.
0.5712955	0.66580874	"This is a quality anti-glare, fingerprint resistant protector/cover that lives up to the hype. Problem is, it tends to cut the sharpness of the iPhone 5 retina screen in the process. I wish I had purchased the  ""clear"" instead. I can probably live with it, it is a great protector. I got mine on ok with the first attempt but needed to use the tape to lift a few specs of dust that got under the cover. Rating it 4 stars out of 5."
0.9914284	0.7840537	The screen protector went on very well.  Good thickness and excellent matte finish, now its setup just like I had done with my iPhone 4S.  That one has been on for a year and still going strong, so I expect similar results with the 5.
0.098288655	0.40676185	I've never really liked these type because I could never get them on without having air bubbles.  This is the first one that didn't produce an air bubble.
0.9576694	0.68887365	I bought this to install on my phone before inserting my phone into the otter box. Very easy to install!
0.85562265	0.7425225999999999	It comes with a well thought out kit to install the screen protector. I love that adhesive tape to clean up the dust particles. No bubbles.Although, the cut out isn't perfect. When I aligned the home button it covered the edge of my camera and the left side of the protector isn't fully covering the left edge. The right side lines up great though. I think when I apply it the next time, I will move it to the left a bit.
0.06923866	0.34250690000000006	I bought this after reading reviews and checking out other products. Shipment arrived on-time, however, the first protector I tried didn't work properly, it just won't stick and hence had big air bubbles, within an hour, it looked awful. Also, you can see finger prints all over, so anti-glare....maybe (could not try since main function of screen sticking to the surface of the phone didn't work properly)....definitely not anti fingerprints as they claim.I sent an email to them since some of the review stated that they had excellent service and Tech Armor solve the problem. No reply what so ever. So, be careful guys. Maybe I am the unlucky one here, but I have awesome cases yet no screen protector!!!!!!!
0.028765053	0.36402106	If you have the smallest piece of dust on your screen, you get a nice bubble, even particulates I couldn't see!  Then, you think it's clean, you put on the protector, and all the little invisible dust particles stick to it, making it useless. I imagine they include 3 in the package because they know you're going to waste some practicing.  You need a sterile laboratory environment to get it done right.  If I hadn't wasted them all, I'd send them back.  I'll never buy these again.  I use one that has adhesive on the ends only, not over the screen.  It gets dirty, take it off, wash it, reinstall, no problem.
0.96932274	0.82960534	For a third the price of some of the higher end screen protectors you get 3 of these and in my opinion they are just as good. Note that these do show finger prints quite a bit but so does the bare screen. Applying this in a steamy bathroom and  using the hinge method [...]  I was able to install these on 2 different phone perfectly, a feat I have never accomplished before!
0.23163491	0.28129536	But I lost them before I was able to use them.  I'm still looking but no luck finding them yet. I'll keep trying.
0.99379337	0.8297235999999999	I got the glare proof covers. The instructions were a little bit confusing as the clear and glare proof have a different application technique. Once I figured it out, though, no problems. Very nice and very tough product. Should last. Touch screen on iPhone 5 works perfectly with this cover on.
0.9147103999999999	0.75066125	Can we first talk about how fast I got my screen protectors!? I ordered them Monday night and got them Wednesday morning. Amazon said I would get it in 3-5 days, but it ended up being 2!I had originally gotten a zagg screen protector, and although they are completely scratch proof, I wanted something more discreet and thinner. The zagg one seems to be super super thick, and looks kind of bumpy, even after a week (instructions says to let a few days for bumps to leave). Also, I paid $15 for just ONE screen protector, and somehow I got some black stuff on it that was unremovable, so it left a black spot on the top left of my screen, and knowing I only had one screen protector, I had to deal with it. Also, the protector kind of makes the screen look a tiny bit fuzzy, not too much, but just enough for me to notice and bug me every morning.ANYWAYS, back to this screen protector.I got it and read the instructions carefully. I followed them but wasn't quick enough and some dust got stuck in the middle, leaving bubbles. Whatever I didn't care, I had two other protectors. I applied the second one, and it was a perfect fit! I took out all the bubbles with the little credit card wiper, and it looked awesome! I'm so glad I got this protector, it doesn't even look like it's there. It's so thin and looks so clear. AND it was only $7, for 3 of them. What a steal.I'm just hoping it doesn't get scratches quickly, and even if it does get scratched every few months I don't really care, I have one more protector and can always buy more since they're so cheap.I definitely recommend this to new iPhone 5 users.
0.16617405	0.46127564	I have used ZAGG and it was difficult to put the shield on the screen and I wanted to give this a try. I wish I didnt because the screen is not clear at all. When the sun shines, I really have trouble seeing the phone screen. It is easy to put it on the screen but you loose the vision. I would recommend not to use anything instead of using this.
0.99849653	0.70143455	This is the best screen saver I have ever used and I am very picky!  It was the easiest ever to put on and I am highly recommending it!  Thanks so much for making my life easier.
0.4336503	0.4627236	It's easy to install.  I did not have any issue with bubbles.  The first set I got was defective and I could not line up the top and bottom cutouts.  I returned it and ordered another one.  I was able to line up the cutouts in my first try on the second set.  It's a good screen protector.  I can't see or feel any difference in touch or screen resolution after I put it on.
0.96894467	0.84721243	I usually hate screen protectors because most scratch easily, collects dust, or become sticky or tacky when using them.  The Tech Armor Premium HD screen protectors have a great &#34;almost&#34; glass type feel that glides well with fingers or stylus and has protected my screen from many drops.  My most recent drop was from the height of my truck bed onto asphalt nd the screen protector got busted up and I thought my screen was damaged too...but after peeling it off, to my surprise, screen was perfectly fine except for some scratches on the metal frame around the screen.  Extremely please with the result.  It come with 3 so its a bargain if you need to replace them from time to time.  Install is super easy and I recommend spraying some Windex or screen cleaner liquid to do a wet install for perfect position and zero bubbles.
0.9747950999999999	0.7168418000000001	Easy to installGreat matte finishWonderful online support and directionsI will definitely be going to Tech Armor when for my other tech needs
0.6774074999999999	0.76161087	Update 2: I just recently recieved the HD clear version and they are much better for my purposes. I also found the HD clear version easier to apply than the matte version, but that could just be because I'm getting better at putting them on. Overall, I'm very happy with this product and with Tech Armor's customer service.Update 1: Since I wasn't entirely satisfied with the matte screen protector, Tech Armor has offered to send me the HD clear version of their screen protector instead at no additional cost to me. This is Tech Armor's famous customer service at work and for this I have increased my rating by a star. I will update this again after trying out the clear version of their screen protector.Original Review: I got the matte version of Tech Armor's screen protector.I was very impressed with how much it cut down on glare, making it much easier to use my phone outside on a sunny day. I was also impressed by how well it prevented smudgy fingerprints from building up on the screen.Unfortunately, the matte screen protector causes the iPhone's ultra-sharp retina display to look fuzzy and unfocused. I thought that maybe I just didn't clean the screen well enough before applying the screen protector, so I took the one I just put on off, cleaned the screen more with the included cloth, then tried to apply a second screen protector. Alas, the second screen protector made the iPhone's display look fuzzy as well. I tried to keep the screen protector on for a while thinking that I'd get used to it, but after a couple of days I just couldn't handle it anymore and I had to remove it.The bottom line is this:The matte screen protector does what it advertises to do by cutting down glare and resisting fingerprints, but it does so at the cost of making your iPhone's crisp display look a little blurry.
0.989859	0.8292625	I have owned this product for over a year. Very good quality and doesn't leave fingerprints! Not only is it a great product but I had gone through all 3 of the screen protectors over the course of a year due to scratching the surface with keys and normal wear/tear. I contacted Tech Armor and asked what needed to be done to get a replacement sent to me since it was a lifetime warranty. A few answered questions later and a brand new pack of replacement screen protectors came in the mail within 2 days! Amazing customer service and they will be getting my business again in the future!
0.99801075	0.8992054	I've used several screen protectors on family's phones ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive. Never been satisfied especially with the expensive ones obviously. Bubbles and peeling from edges even with a bumper cover. Tech Armor product was very reasonably priced and I've installed on a couple phones now and still looks great.
0.9922223	0.8793478000000001	This is a great screen. It fits perfectly, and I don't even know it's covering the face of my phone.Unlike other people, I highly recommend aligning the cover over the home button first, and then putting it on the rest of the phone. The tolerance for the fit around the home button is very exact, whereas there is much more margin for error at the top (speaker/sensors).
0.9181485	0.71588904	Easy to use and applyI've only had it on for a week and it's already saved my screen from a major scratch
0.99542785	0.7851566	First I ordered the Matte Finish, applied it easily and flawlessly! The company emailed me asking for feedback, I was honest and shared that I don't like the texture for the matte finish (I can hear my finger touching it and I felt like I lost some of the crispness of the image on my screen). I offered to send back the 2 screens I had left out of my package of 3 in exchange for 2 anti-glare ones instead. They surprised me! They told me that wasn't necessary and that they would send me the new package of anti-glare free of cost. Are you kidding me? Who does that in today's world?! They sent it, they arrived fast and they have blown me away. Hands down, will get all screens from them here on out. Such impeccable customer service is to be appreciated! Thank you for being so quick to communicate, generous to offer another product and overall the best customer service I've ever had on amazon.Thank you! I HIGHLY recommend their products, I love the anti-glare screen much more than the matte, that's my preference!
0.97812283	0.8115168	It's as described high quality,easy installation and fit fits the screen.  If i could give more than 5 stars i would give a 1000000 stars for this product.. Thanx guys from Tech Armor
0.568285	0.39214694	my Tech Armor screen protector is Scratch when my iphone in my pocketthats very bad Screen Protector..
0.07526648	0.37905687	The screen protector comes in a three pack because that is how many times it will take to get it to work correctly. They are not easy to put on, the card board smoother is ridiculous. Now looking for a matt finish one that does not show the finger prints as badly. This is not the first time I install a screen protector either.
0.76053154	0.7219561999999999	I'm usually pretty bad at putting these things on, but this time around I did my research. Following another reviewer's technique of using scotch tape to act as a level when placing the protector on the phone itself worked, I had a lot less air bubbles than I usually do. I just got my phone yesterday and I was so excited about everything that I misplaced the smoothing card that comes with the kit. Used a credit card which somewhat worked, then found the card which worked better. So far, so good. The screen protector has a matte finish, but it doesn't make a noticeable difference in pixelation/viewing quality of pictures.  I would recommend this to others.
0.97860277	0.7705506999999999	works as it says!very thin , and block other vision on 4 ways.Easy to set, and very well cut.
0.9977517	0.77540547	A nice kit. Well presented and very helpful video. And it works well. First time I've used one of these and managed to apply it perfectly.
0.9909674	0.8107138	I ordered anOtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Boltfor my iPhone 5 and ordered these at the same time.  At first I figured it was a waste of time and money since the Otterbox already had a screen protector included, but I was wrong.As it turned out, I didn't like the Otterbox protector.  The Tech Armor protectors are better made and seem to fit the phone better.  So I'm using one in place of the Otterbox item, and am far more satisfied with it.The first one was a bust applying it to the phone. User error. The second one fits perfectly. This, along with the Otterbox, makes my iPhone beautifully protected.Highly recommend the product. Good stuff.
0.9789219000000001	0.75788146	This is a great screen protector! They give you all the pieces to ensure there are no dust spots or bubbles.Thanks for a great product!
0.66013193	0.5879063	I bought this item on a whim because it was afforable and I wanted to try out the matte finish on my iPhone. I got it in the mail this morning (as expected), and instantly was pained with the thought that I would have to take off my old glossy screen protector and spend another 2 hours to put on this one. NOT THE CASE. I decided to put it while sitting in my driver's seat, using my binder as a backboard and I got it on, sans bubbles, in about 4 minutes. I'm liking this product so far, granted, it's only been about an hour since I put it on, but the easy application made my life a lot easier.
0.99794674	0.78538907	Great deal for the price. Easy to put on with no bubbles under the protector.  Highly recommended and a must have.
0.985707	0.8074058000000001	This  screen saver is great for the iPhone 5.  No glare and it fits perfectly!  The product has three screen protectors, but after a few months of use, mine needreplacing anyway, so this is a great deal.  I'll never use another brand for my iPhone 5!
0.35372484	0.57417053	This set of screen protectors are made of good quality film. Application is easy, but I do find it better to have #1 sticker completely removed then apply the protector film. Just make sure you get the sticky side of the protector as close to the screen as possible when you remove sticker #1, to avoid dust settling.
0.9978734	0.82533044	I used other good protectors in the past and this my first with Tech Armor. I must say it was easy to put on and just 2 bubbles to get out. Instructions were clear in easy to follow. I will purchase again!
0.091736645	0.45451376	Collects too much fingerprints. Should've gotten a different one. I have to wipe my iPhone constantly it's annoying. So yeah 2 stats
0.89880204	0.77738535	I purchased this item for the price and positive feedback from buyers. It turned out to be true. Very easy to install as long you stay patient and read through the instructions carefully. The only reason why i put 4 stars is because it doesn't stop fingerprints mark on the screen. Other than that, it's a good product. Doesn't cause any insensitivity when your fingers uses the screen. And, it almost look like invisible. Quite fast when they shipped it, which is really great.
0.8493343000000001	0.73329794	I received it on expected date of delivery, and it was as advertised. It was easy to put on with out any air pockets and no rainbow glare effect.
0.78868616	0.75353765	There are three screen protectors inside. Easy to apply and great quality! The dust removers are also fantastic. However, be careful when you remove the second 'finish' membrane, I removed the whole thing (including the screen protector) when removed it without realizing it, thus wasted one.
0.32381052	0.45873925	My iPhone 4 privacy screen did not show the visible cross hatch lines that make the privacy screen possible. However, the Tech Armor Ultimate 4-Way 360 Degree Screen Protector does.
0.9964199	0.8401929	I have bought several privacy screens in the past for various phones, this one by far is the best one. No streaks, easy on/off - and best of all it is really a 4-way privacy!!!
0.9035933	0.7125389	"Simply the best and easiest installation I've ever done.  I followed the directions by pulling back 2"" of the first film and as I removed the balance of the film the protector laid down without a single bubble. I can't really rate the durability of the screen protector itself because it was literally just delivered. But I had to write this review just based on the ease of installation. It also appears to be very case-friendly."
0.90779746	0.7643446999999999	I always buy multiple screen protectors because I always screw them up or get dust under them or something. These came with a dust removing sticker, which was a HUGE help. They also came with a little card to squeeze the bubbles out without putting scratches in the protector. The first one I installed was cut just a little tiny bit too small, but not something I would complain about. The second one I used fit the screen perfectly. And the best part is that the first one went on smoothly, so I didn't even have to waste any. I would purchase these again, for sure.
0.15378657	0.43146592	&#34;high definition&#34; is a misnomer. More like cheap plastic covers that don't fit well. I recommend KlearKare for the money, and I am NOT affiliated in any way
0.8714253000000001	0.7686666	Success was achieved the first time I put on the Tech Armor Screen protector on both of our new iPhone 5's.  We have all tried this many times and it often leads to frustration and often throwing one away.  But both of these went on PERFECTLY the first time.  I did watch the web video on the Tech Armor web site, but it was pretty much the same instructions as you get with other brands.Make sure your screen is perfectly clean, dry and dust free.  Then just follow the instructions.  I did put on some surgical gloves I had to make sure I did not transfer any skin oils to the sticky side.Take your time and you will be quite pleased with the end result.  You cannot see that it is on and the feel is the same as the plain glass.
0.9765381999999999	0.8045846	Bought these for my new iPhone 5 and they seem to work great!!! Was a little tricky lining up the camera and speaker hole but other than that I would recommend these..
0.18912825	0.52667785	I've tried many different brands over the years and I have to say that this is the worst.  They do not go on well and I normally have no problem.  I went through the whole pack of 3 without any satisfaction.
0.005362331999999999	0.43115708	Worst protector ever.Don't buy it. It scrached when I try to place onto iphonewith soft cloth.  It's been 2 weeks and its peelingfrom the bottom with air bubbles.
0.018527001	0.5927945	Whatever you do, do not buy this! It may seem like a decent product, but the screens will peel off within a month. They are cheap and made with an awful adhesive.
0.9711393	0.72772497	This screen protector was easy to apply and so far it seems like it would provide adequate protection from scratches.
0.99910486	0.7414666999999999	This is a wonderful product with affordable price.  Really like it.  I would highly recommend to my friends, especially for the Matte style.
0.25008893	0.49022299999999996	It is a great product, but I had a hard time trying to put it together on my Iphone 5. The cut of the holes for the ear and the button were did not line up. :(
0.88134766	0.53609335	I bought these because I found a really good price but still had some others. Anyway, I recommend it for that reason
0.9976826999999999	0.6918745	Great product I love it I recently bought one for my iPhone 4s and then I recently got iPhone 5s and this was my go to because it is awesome protector screen and I love the privacy.
0.21472028	0.42892438	Just as advertised.  I don't know what else to say.  Be careful to remove all the dust and oil from your phone's screen before applying the device.
0.96021396	0.84001595	I bought a Skinomi protector for my husband and his was nice too, but not as matte and has no anti-fingerprint like the Tech Armor.  I used the Zoogue screen protector (prior to applying the Tech Armor) and while it was nice, it was very shiny and left a rainbow effect on the screen. Not so with Tech Armor protector. I give this one 5 stars. Very good price for 3 protectors. I shared one package with my son and daughter. For some reason my daughter said she spent a long time putting it on because she had to use the tape to remove lots of dust. For me I put it on in less than 5 minutes. Product was easy to apply when screen is clean and free of dust. I used the squeegee from the Skinomi protector. The Skinomi squeegee is soft silicone type material that is the same width as the iPhone. Therefore, it didn't scratch the protector (like some hard plastic card) and one sweep over the phone covers the whole width to remove bubble. The Tech Armor protector was easy to apply. The surface is very matte and leaves no fingerprint at all. I am very impressed.
0.9883145000000001	0.8746757	I've had other brands of screen protectors that would scratch just by wiping the dust off with a cloth.  The Tech Armor protector is very scratch resistant.  I'm constantly wiping the screen clear with my t-shirt and there is no evidence of scratches!  If you follow the instructions properly and lay it on your phone with no dust underneath, you can't even tell its there.  I'm using this in conjunction with my Otterbox iPhone case.  I peeled off the Otterbox screen protector (which scratched really easily), which was attached to the case and applied the Tech Armor directly to the phone.  Looks and works great!  I highly recommend it!
0.06873053	0.42594433	DON'T BUY THIS TO BLACK AND IT GOT OUT IN TWO WEEKSGET  BETTER SCREEN PROTECTOR THAT LAST MOREOK
0.02266255	0.5435844	I thought I had found the best price vs. value option after searching for 1/2 hour on Amazon and Google for the best reviewed screen protectors for the new Iphone 5.Unfortunately I was disappointed and 15 minutes after getting started I had a lot of plastic waste and still not screen protector.First it's near impossible to get the screen protector on 100% properly aligned because it's cut out to fill 99% of the screen, thus if it is even the slightest bit off it doesn't stick to the screen on the side it's too close.Secondly because it takes longer and doesn't sit easily right away in the 30 seconds usually some dust lands on the phone or sticky side of the screen.These might be rather common issues of sticky screens, however after wasting 2 screens and somewhat getting the 3rd screen on with only 2 dust bubbles underneath I test the screen and see that it extremely attracts smudge.Within seconds of using it is really dirty and doesn't clean easily either.I will now go for a more expensive screen that will actually not only protect but also allow me to see look at the screen and not instantly get totally smudged.
0.90294254	0.8067588000000001	The clarity with this protector is amazing. It's truly does look like there is nothing on the screen. Application was a little difficult--I wasted one of the protectors during installation--however difficulties were attributable to complications inherent to all protectors, dust particles.While the clarity is impeccable, the protector does seem notably thinner than other protectors, so I question the durability and longevity. That's probably one of the trade offs for clarity.As a side note, there was a note inside the package saying that if I left a review, I would receive a 2nd package for free.As others have noted, be aware there are only 3 in the package (as stated in the item title) even though the packaging says 4.
0.98387045	0.84015846	"Super easy and quick installation. The protector is a nice thickness. Comes with a front and back cover to be removed at time of install. Accessories such as wiping cloth, sticky lint remover (for adhesive side of protector), and squigee make this a complete kit for excellent results. No rainbow effect.The opening for the front camera is wider than necessary. But it doesn't block the camera at all.The ""HD"" in the name is marketing rubbish. But this product really maintains perfect clarity."
0.6057183	0.1726175	It was a gift so I think I gave it away...I can't say much about it I just try to review everything I get lol
0.670031	0.30857852	Excelente protector de pantalla, elimina el reflejo y no deja marca de huellas, es una excelenete opcion a precio razonable
0.049147993	0.48388028	All 3 included screen protectors failed VERY VERY cheap quality. the labels that say peel them will not come off with an acetone thats how bad they are glued to both parts.
0.9711540000000001	0.71932477	I give 5 stars for this screen protector for its ease of install and clear instructions. I had some difficulty installing screen protector on iPhone 4 two years ago but not this time on iPhone 5 . It worked the first time without a single bubble. Moreover,it came on time. I am completely satisfied with the product and the service.
0.9853643	0.8046305	I was looking for a basic screen protector but came across this one.  I'm so glad that I read previous reviews on this product.  It definitely lives up to all the hype.  I noticed that once it was on it was actually a little off center.  I was able to remove and reuse.  It's totally amazing!!  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.  ***** I emailed customer service last Sunday to request a replacement.  I received a response within 10 minutes and my replacement is in the mail.  That's what I call customer service.
0.98727816	0.85608494	I have tried to install screen protectors for previous phones, and it has always been a frustrating failure. I previously decided that I would probably never be able to install one correctly, and for my last two phones I have paid the ridiculous prices to have someone else install one for me. I decided to try myself once again after reading the reviews for this one, and the installation went absolutely flawless!I followed the advice of another reviewer and installed in the bathroom after running the shower on hot for about 10 minutes. I lined up the screen protector with the home button first, then slowly peeled back the cover as I moved up the phone. I had to reposition it twice before I finally got it perfectly lined up on all four sides, and I did not end up with one single speck of dust underneath. I had just a couple of very small bubbles, and they were extremely easy to push out with the included card. I also watched the YouTube video from Tech Armor a couple of times and followed its advise.Another reviewer said his protector did not cover the bottom of the phone under the home button, but that is not the case with the ones I received. They must have redesigned them. The cutouts for the home button, the camera and sensor, and the speaker all fit perfectly.I bought the same case that Amazon shows as frequently bought together with these protectors (SF Matte Black - Apple iPhone 5 Ringke SLIM Soft Feeling Premium Hard Case) and it does not interfere with the screen protectors at all. I was able to install the protectors while the phone was in the case, which helped me clean the screen without touching it.I will be ordering Tech Armor protectors for all my phones in the future, and I am ordering another set for my wife's phone (4S) today. Highly recommended.
0.84798443	0.69715345	These worked to protect my iphone with my speck case. So far I've applied one and it went on ever so slightly uneven, so it is pulling up a little on one side, but there are two more to apply when it starts to bug me, so I can't complain. Watch the video before application.
0.97521144	0.81901526	Its a perfect fit, make sure to wipe off all the dirt. Even a tiny dot of dirt will create an air bubble. One of the screen guards was an experimental one, I scored with the second one. Without any air bubbles, you cannot event tell that the screen guard is there. Looks awesome.
0.7891439	0.7225020000000001	Screen protector works great for me. It does not completely cover edge to edge as there is maybe 1 millimeter on each side, however, if you have a case on your iphone5, this will get covered up by the case. You can't tell that there is a screen protector on my phone, it is thin, yet feels durable. Does not bubble on the edges from the case. Application was easy, absolutely 0 bubbles. Squeegee was included as well as a cleaning cloth and instructions. I would recomment this.
0.9939515	0.8082505	Screen protector was just as described. Shipped quickly, no issues with order.  Protector went on very easily and with a perfect fit!
0.7851819	0.71683216	I would rather have scratches on my screen than this protector.  I figure...enjoy the phone for 2 year and wear sunglasses to cut down glare.
0.99925387	0.8281708000000001	Recently purchased item, following instructions installed perfectly, screen looks great, and a perfect fitfor the phone, always use screen protection on my Iphones over the years, like the non-glare screen.Nice to see that pack everything needed to do a perfect installation. John B.
0.9499558000000001	0.83115196	This screen protector is of great quality and it is very clear.  My iphone screen looks practically the same as if it wouldn't have the screen protector.  It was very easy to install and didn't leave bubbles.  When installing, I recommend you place your iphone over a paper towel or other surface that don't let it slide.  This facilitates aligning the edges.  The key to have no bubbles is to ensure you clean the surface very well with the lint-free cloth included in the package.  I gave one of the protectors to a friend and he loved it!!!
0.26857072	0.64443606	Overall not a bad product. Inexpensive for three pieces. The protector is not the exact same size as the phone and it leaves a little exposure on the edges. Dry fit it first so you get the idea. My first try I aligned the protector with the bottom edge perfectly only to have the camera hole slightly off. So I removed it and reapplied the same protector. The first application went on practically bubble free and I was able to smooth the one or two very small bubbles that were present. The second time I put it on I had many more bubbles but the alignment was better. I was able to squeeze most of the bubbles out. I am sure if I used a new piece on my second attempt I would have had better results. But, I figure I will replace it when it gets scratched up or starts coming off eventually and I will have better luck next time.  This first attempt looks good enough and it will do for now. To easily remove the first attempt I just stuck a piece of blue painters tape to it and it came right up. No residue from the protector was left behind.
0.9596889999999999	0.80495906	Even though I screwed up the first application attempt, the second went on smoothly and without any bubbles at all. My only complaint is that the screen protectors are slightly smaller than the actual iPhone screen is. It works well for making iPhone cases easy to install, but it practically guarantees that dust will gather in the tiny line between the protector and the edge of the phone. Other than that, this is definitely worth the money; just know now that if you don't like dust accumulating around the edge of the phone, this screen protector might bother you a bit.
0.9839962999999999	0.7588699999999999	this is second time I buy this item.as good as always,very easy to operate,you can use tape to undo it if any problems while you install.after all,very good
0.9130159	0.57462865	Product is awesome bought a second one for a friend because the zagg one was not nearly as good! Thanks!
0.9299586999999999	0.6918251999999999	I never use a screen protector before so I messed the first one up. However, upon reading very simple instruction, I realized how easy it is to get the protector perfectly applied. Way more value than what I paid for
0.9980994000000001	0.87230194	Package arrived sooner than I expected and I was pleased. This product was as described, very easy to install, no glare no fingerprints, no bubbles.
0.68639725	0.6088819000000001	Shield worked well once installed. Was difficult to install without air bubbles.  Improve the instructions and add a second tab to remove the top sheet and this will be a good product
0.9380814000000001	0.7524563	It really is matte which is nice if you have sticky fingers.  It has a bit of a texture to it too so I think it is easier to to slide my finger around on it.  It does distort the gorgeous iPhone 5 screen though so that is a downside.  I've had the same one on with no bubbles or peeling for about 6 months now.  I might switch to a clear protector soon though just to compare.
0.56355864	0.3217731	I haven't used a screen protector before on my iPhone, but thought I give this one a try. I watched the video and followed the instructions, but there are some stubborn bubbles that can't be coaxed out. The product is clear and does not seem to affect responsiveness, but the bubbles are anoying.
0.9921247	0.7955502	Love it. Can't even tell it is on the phone. Would buy again because of the price and the great directions with the screen protectors.
0.22469622	0.45160213	I was really excited to receive these case protectors as I have just bought my first iPhone and I wanted to make sure it was completely protected. I had to use all three of the screen protectors at once because I would have a problem each time -- either the protector would not line up or there would be too many bubbles that could not be removed even by re-lifting it and using the smoother card. Even now, with my last protector on, it is not lined up properly.Another thing (although this is probably my fault), I ordered the matte screen protector thinking it would just shield from glare but still be invisible. It makes my phone look slightly blurry and I don't like the way it feels when I touch the screen. Had I known this, I would have ordered the clear ones.I will probably still keep this protector on my screen just to keep it safe until I can find a different one.
0.9980222	0.8733791	These arrived in two days by mail and I couldn't be happier. I opened the pack expecting to see three flimsy cellophane protectors in a sleeve. What I received was three slightly thicker protectors, note thanking me for my purchase, detailed installation instructions, card to smooth out any wrinkles and a piece of dust removal tape. Installation was super easy and lined up well. Took about 3 minutes maybe and didn't leave any bubbles or those little dust blip things. The protector itself is a matte finish. Only con I have is minor. Using the phone without a protector the screen is brighter and more vibrant color-wise. The protector tends to darken the screen slightly. I recommend these protectors to anyone. Thanks!- Jake in Charlotte
0.628587	0.6859270000000001	this is great it gets little glare and no smudges. also its thick enough to protect the screen only thing i dont like is it cuts the clarity of the screen down a bit but it doesnt matter cuz its a phone not a tv.
0.99925685	0.8106892	Easy To Put On And Great For The Price.I would Recommend This To Anyone.It Is A Fantastic Product That Protects My Screen Very Well
0.83919203	0.85568523	This is a great product, but must be installed correctly. I'm sure like most people, I used up the whole pack and finally got it right on the last one.A few tips:1. READ DIRECTIONS.---Seems simple, but the actual protector has two thin films over it. An easy way to screw up is taking off the wrong one and attempting to install backwards. Read the directions fully (2 or 3 times if you wish) before even beginning installation.2. Work in a well lit area.---This makes it much easier to see dust on the screen prior, avoiding the hassle of trying to lifting the protector and remove the dust with tape.3. Wash your hands.---Dirty hands = sloppy installation.4. Wipe, Wipe, Wipe... and Wipe again.---The little cloth they give you is nice and does its job well. After wiping all the grease and oil off the screen, lay your phone down on a flat surface with lots of light and brush the cloth lightly over the top to remove dust. Move your head around, angle the light, look for dust, brush again. Part of the trouble I had the second try was with a tiny speck of dust trapped underneath the cover. I tried using the tape but ended up ruining the cover when I touched it.5. After removing the film cover part, don't touch the sticky protector surface. If you do, just trash it and start over.Final Thoughts: If you're looking for a cheap way to protect your screen that's relatively easy to install, buy this product. I found it easier to use the bottom of the screen and the home button to line up the protector. Note that the ear and camera holes on the protector do not line up perfectly to allow the sensors to function properly. If it was not for that, I wouldn't even be able to tell I had a screen protector on the phone. Overall, solid product.UPDATE:Contacted the company after having difficulty with installation and they sent me a pack of 3 for free. Excellent customer service.
0.51348686	0.37994272	ok what do I say about this it fits nice and protects the glass on my phone ok I guess I have nothing else to say happy days
0.96329665	0.6313502	Went to local store that was charging $35 for 1 screen protector!  Very happy with this n it came with 3!
0.9939752000000001	0.72501254	Such a good price for this product. Comes with cloth to clean your screen and 3 covers. Love it, thanks!
0.9951813	0.8162708000000001	Tech Armor is a great product and so easy to apply. Went on easilIy with no bubbles the first try. I'm very happy with my purchase!
0.99349356	0.8882245000000001	For the price asked, these are a good value. Included is a screen wipe to remove dust and oil from your iPhone prior to application. The screen protectors are easy to apply with no air bubbles and stay in place. These protectors in no way affect your iPhone's touchscreen responsiveness and the high definition coating allow you to see the retina display in it's full vivid spectrum. These protectors are prone to some scratching after extended usage, so make sure you buy several packs of them!
0.99656534	0.82120746	Great Product very durable against scratches and comes with warranty I would definitely buy it again this is a Tech armor brand product. I would definitely trust Tech armor screen protectors with other devices I buy.
0.49675575	0.5455390999999999	Came with a warranty paper, 3 protectors that are very nice.. Make sure u know how to put these on, i used all 3 to put it on my phone since dust kept getting on it.. As a product it was good... Resolution on phone was not impaired.. Barely noticeable..  All good
0.73581433	0.79083323	I bought both this screen protector and the Tech Armor anti-glare screen protector. I am giving both five stars. I don't see much wrong with either one. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages. The ultra clear version maintains the beautiful graphics of the retina display, but shows fingerprints more easily. In contrast, the anti-glare version has a slight texture that feels better to some people and keeps off glare and fingerprints, but it also causes a slightly degraded clarity.Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles... Folks, this issue is not a reason for taking off stars. If you have bubbles, it's user error. That should be comforting to know because that means you can fix it. As I said, I have both screen protectors. I was able to install each screen without bubbles the first time and with perfect alignment. Yes, that means I have 2 remaining screen protectors for each version (4 remaining total). Here's the trick for consistent installation results. You have to work in a dust free environment because each tiny spec of dust represents a bubble that will be difficult to remove. The poor man's way of getting a dust free environment is steam up the bathroom (not too much though). The steam causes the dust to fall. Then, come in the bathroom and do your install. Make sure there is plenty of light, your hands are clean, and your screen has zero dust. If it still doesn't work, you might just be a stumbler who needs somebody else to do it.BOTTOM LINE:I am keeping the ultra-clear protector on my screen because I have come to realization the retina display of the iPhone 5 is meant to be enjoyed with ultra-clarity.
0.9962513000000001	0.7811403	Luckily I was able to get one on my screen on my very first try. Love this product and it works exactly as advertised.
0.99853814	0.88679326	- Quick Delivery- Exactly what description and picture shows- Fits, looks, feels, and works perfectly with phoneI highly recommend purchasing this if youre looking for no hassle, and something guaranteed to work.
0.99969244	0.8695879000000001	Great product and very durable. I would highly recommend this product. Pricing is also right. The phone guards are perfect fit.
0.9729539	0.6175201	I received this with my new iPhone 5s cover.  I watched the recommended video, applied the sheet protector, and voila!  Happy customer!
0.99876463	0.8168994	No complaints here at all. Fits the iphone 5 perfectly and now I can sleep easy knowing the glass is protected while in my wife's purse.
0.15549678	0.3545977	Like most screen proctetors, it's almost impossible to get it perfect. I followed the directions to a t and cleaned my phone first but if ANY small lint or dust somehow sticks to your screen or the screen protector after peeling then that try is ruined.
0.9979174999999999	0.85731924	This screen protector is the best I've ever used, hands down!  So smooth and doesn't leave any fingerprints or alter the color clarity of my iPhone 5.  Amazing product!  Worth the buy!
0.9885671	0.8460833000000001	"I purchased this Tech Armor a screen cover with a slim case. The screen is one of the best of many screen I have purchased (for previous iphone 4). It is great it comes three since I made a mistake when installing the first one: I did not notice the ""(1)"" and ""(2)"" side of the screen, and put the wrong side (2) down. The second try works nicely - easy to install without any ""air"" bubbles if you follow the instructions. The screen is about 0.5 mm (1/32 to 1/62 of an inche) narrower in each edge than the iPhone 5 screen. I first thought it was a problem, but after installation, I think it is by design so that the screen cover could not be lift up accidentally (like my old iPhone 4 screen) - a nice thoughtful design. Some people have bubbles problems, I also had that at the first installation - than I found I may have reversed the side and putting the wrong facing the screen. Check instruction, start from a cover and partially peered cover. I also cleaned the phone screen first with a little lightly soapy water (power off the phone) and wiped all dust before installation."
0.9794773999999999	0.79163647	This is one of the best screen protectors I've found. It doesn't bubble up when you apply it and and does exactly what it is supposed to.
0.9983405999999999	0.9136184000000002	You can't beat this for the price. Its infuriating that cell phone stores, or Best Buy can get away with charging $20 for a single screen protector. For a third of the price, you get three high quality protectors!They install easily, are easy to clean, and are surprisingly scratch resistant. Don't get ripped off by the retail stores. Get these instead. I promise you won't regret it.Install Note: The best advice I've read for an easy install is to line the protector up on the phone BEFORE removing the protective film and use a small square of painter's tape to affix the protector to the phone like a hinge. Then just peel the plastic off on the sticky side of the screen protector and roll it onto the phone. I've used this method several times on friend's and family's phones and I get it perfect every time.
0.32743990000000006	0.4855156	otter box and car charger and screen protecters came on time , but lighting cable and adapter on back order
0.99897844	0.83000493	After reading all of the reviews I was confident in the product's performance so I placed an order.  It was a little tricky at first getting it on without bubbles and lint which also create bubbles, but I was able to get it on well enough to my satisfaction.  The coolest part was that TechArmor reached out to me to make sure everything went well and when I mentioned I had the lint which was no fault of the product (user error), they happily sent me a replacement immediately for free without any questions because they wanted me to have it working perfectly.  I just put the new screen on and it looks great.The product and the customer service with a lifetime guarantee is pretty amazing and worth the purchase all day long.
0.99136055	0.77943957	This screen protector is very easy to apply and it only took me like 1min to put this on. This is a very high quality product and I can't even tell after I put this on my phone.
0.30015105	0.5329535	What I received was not a privacy screen, it is simply a screen protector. A real screen protector disrupts a person view by making the image on the screen none view-able or at least not noticeable to someone looking at your phone from a angle. I am well aware of how privacy screens work because I see them everyday at work. As far a a screen protector, its great but that's not what I asked for.
0.7050451	0.7360903	High quality material and a good fit. Great value considering the number that come in the package, though I don't expect to have to replace the one I installed for a long time. Smudges are visible, but they aren't as bad as I expected them to be (coming from a matte screen protector on my old phone). The surface is very easy to manipulate my fingers on.
0.7343174	0.79621184	Pros:This screen protector is quite simple to apply. Anyone can do it in just a minute or so.They give you extra protectorsAmazing clarity (as long as it's spotlessly clean)Cons:Shows every single fingerprint, smudge, smear, streak, and dust particle so prominently that it's hard to see past it.Must be cleaned every single time the phone is handled.I have already taken this off my phone after a few weeks, after trying both of the extra screen protectors. It's ability to showcase fingerprints (and yes, I wash my hands!) completely detracts from the beauty of my sleek iPhone. Got the invisibleshield instead - FAR superior!
0.92971516	0.57251364	This item worked exactly as I had hoped.  So much cheaper than the products from Apple, just as good in my opinion.  I would purchase again.  This was for the iP5.
0.90140486	0.6697529000000001	was easy to install , put them on since I work in the construction field , save my screen , with both the case and screen savers can't go wrong
0.9257584999999999	0.8397213	First off, don't fall for the photo of this product--that is just some clever photoshopping. The actual product shipped is the old iPhone 5 protectors. The packaging looks nothing like what is shown here on Amazon.That didn't affect the the functionality, though. These work just fine with the iPhone 5S. I was worried they might not allow the fingerprint scanner to work properly, but they fit just fine.Installation is easy enough, I would recommend watching their install video first, and use the dust tape that comes with it--it is the difference maker between having a pristine screen and looking at a dust bubble for the next year or so.One note, of the 3 protectors, I was unable to use 1, because it had apparently separated from the outer layer sometime between being manufactured and arriving to me, which had caused hundreds of pieces of dust and bits to adhere to the protector itself. I had to toss that one. Other than that, installed 2 on the new 5S's and was very pleased with the overall look and, more importantly, their compatibility.**UPDATED**Customer service sent me a replacement protector upon reading my review. VERY pleased with this level of customer satisfaction. Thank You!2 weeks later--screen protector doing its job wonderfully!
0.94443786	0.57287776	I like my screen protector, i did have a hard time getting it on the phone just rite now I know why they come as a package of three. over all i'm pleased with this product
0.057455868	0.44523978	I got these in case I got dirt or bubbles under the protectors that came with our phone cases.  When I turned to these as a backup plan they were terrible.  Not even half as good as the one that came with the case.  Very rigid and did not stick well.I opted to go without a screen protector.
0.23028344	0.67288464	The strange thing about this product is that the holes that are cut into it for the microphone, camera, and home button do not line up together. Basically you have to apply this screen protector at a slightly off angle to get it all to fit. It still covers the vast majority of your screen so it isn't a problem, but it is... off. The screen itself does a great job of being a privacy protector, it is difficult to see it even if you're looking at it from the right angle. You could increase your brightness after applying it to be able to read better. If your goal is a privacy screen, this will do it, but it certain;y is not perfect and it is difficult to see your screen as well as before as the user.
0.9994488000000001	0.87047845	Highly recommend. You can read under the Sun. No reflection at all! My friend likes it also. Easy install.Thank Tech Armor.
0.9809483	0.7454529000000001	Just installed these on my new 5S.  Due to my own fault, there was a speck of dust under the first one.  Luckily, they send you three.  The second one went on perfect.  So far, I love it!
0.91472006	0.7295876	"I just installed the screen protector and noticed that it has a few small scratches on the film. Due to the matte finish the scratches are very noticeable. I now need to use another one of the other protectors that I needed for two other phones. I think the other type of screen protectors are clearer.I am updating my review to reflect the ""GREAT"" customer service from Tech Armor Customer Service. After posting my review I received a response from Tech Armor that they will replace the item or refund my purchase cost. With that customer service, they have a customer for life!"
0.99603224	0.85598826	There are a lot of stigmas when it comes to buying and more importantly applying screen protectors. For this item, I was pleasently surprised. Delivery was prompt, instructions were simple and with three screens, it leaves room for error. Additionally, it came with cloth, a firm card and dust removing tape to ease the process. Luckily, I got it on the first try and once applied, I cannot even notice it. The quality is great. Worth the buy.
0.99743664	0.8027542	Very much satisfied with the product and highly recommend. Tip: Wipe the IPhone 5 screen well and make sure no dust is left before applying the protector.
0.91674757	0.6930241	I ordered these after throwing away the screen protector that came with my Otterbox Commuter iPhone 5 case.  I paid an extra $10 to get that case because it came with a screen protector and now I can see it was not a smart buy.These screens look good to me and were easier to install--the one that came with the Otterbox had so many bubbles and I couldn't remove them.  Not with these ones!  Only downside is that the surface feels a tiny bit rubbery, not smooth and glassy like the phone's surface.  Not a deal-breaker though.
0.9962356	0.7373074000000001	Great quality and prices. I'm pretty satisfied with this product.I recommend this for those who prefers the matt-type one.
0.9384924000000001	0.7104473000000001	I was very weary about the application process because I suck at this kind of stuff but I got it on the first try. No bubbles, smudges, or anything. Looks flawless. I even keep checking to make sure the screen protector is on there. It is so invisible. :) Anywho, application was easy and I am sure it will work just great
0.9921221	0.7691555999999999	Thank you! great product! super fast shipping! The quality is better than alot of those other brands sold, nice and sturdy and doesnt peel off 2 days later!
0.96816736	0.7021685000000001	This is by far the most inexpensive and high quality screen protector I have come across for the iPhone 5. It comes in a 3 pack. I would have given 5 stars but it takes some practice to get the screen protector on so you usually go through at least one.
0.9272826	0.66131854	I got a defective package,emailed them, the next day I got a reply telling me that they are sending me another one is first class mail. Very happy about how quick they responded. Overall, a great product! (:
0.98901296	0.81944287	I've bought screen protectors before and fought them to get good, even coverage. This one worked great and no bubbles. Hallelujah.
0.9653980999999999	0.8556453000000002	My husband bought these through Amazon for both of our phones. I am the one who applied them, so I'm writing the review.I followed the simple instructions given in the booklet and got his phone covered perfectly on the first try. I was amazed that it worked so well on the first try. I have put many different screen protectors on our past phones, but never that easily... Then I tried my phone. I followed the directions exactly the same, but both times I tried to put the cover on there was lint or dust underneath the cover that created bubbles over my viewing screen. I was bummed, because I'm the type of person that can't just ignore a blemish like that.My husband contacted Tech Armor, and they promptly sent us a new set of screen protectors, polishing wipe, and a new dust removal sticker. I tried the process again, and it worked right away. I think the reason I was having such a hard time before is because there are three screens, but only one dust removal sticker. I thought I could just reuse it, but maybe not. Even so, the company's dedication to their product and their customers is entirely in their favor.The screen protector itself is a bit rubbery to the touch, like most are, but otherwise unnoticeable. It is also very durable and can withstand much scraping and scratching (I really tried hard to get those bubbles out).I highly recommend this product.
0.9851675999999999	0.78174126	These are perfect screen shields for your iPhone.  The added protection that you need to keep you screen from being scratched.  This is a must for all iPhone users.
0.9170489	0.7916281	The HD Clear are relatively easy to install, but you may need a magnifying glass to read the directions.  They do show smudges and fingerprints much more than the bare screen did. The Anti-Glare Anti-Fingerprint Screen Protectors are an option, but consider the fact that they do have a matte finish. I would recommend the HD Clear to friends but with a warning about the smudges and fingerprints.
0.9986391	0.72834617	Awesome product! Shipped quick, great customer service, easy installation, and works very well as promised! If you have oily skin, this is the screen protector for you!
0.98383933	0.73578274	With as much as I drop my phone, this case is worth it.  I am brutal on my phone.  No more catching a juggle I just let it fall and pick it up.  It's saved me so much money!
0.95842373	0.7248291	Was easier than I thought it would be to apply to my iPhone.  It appears to be great with regard to no fingerprints and I'll see (if the sun ever shines) how it works with regard to anti-glare.  JBL in GOS
0.99675536	0.79956347	Fits perfectly on my iPhone, works efficiently, and i have had no bubble issues or corners peeling up. Great product for a great price!!!
0.95786583	0.83409667	I have never had an Otterbox, so I cannot compare....but this case is very nice and does the job. I have dropped it several times. My 1 year old has dropped it, thrown it, and spit all over it, and my phone is still safe inside. The only thing that I don't like is that the rubber comes off freely around the edges. Sometimes my toddler takes it off but other times it just comes off. I have never had an Otterbox to tell how the rubber compares. I do think this model is attractive and sturdy for the price. I have had it for 3 months and it still looks great.
0.99791694	0.87178236	I have used several iPhone and iPad covers and this one is by far the best I've ever used.  I recommend it to all of my colleagues.  It is such a relief to have a cover that protects the device and at the same time, prevents glare and fingerprints, but still leaves a perfect view of the device.  My kids' dirty fingerprints are long gone!
0.93661	0.84120727	It came with 3 clear screen protectors.  Instructions were very clear and I was able to stick it on my first try.  I'm very impress with the visibility and smoothness of this screen protector.  My brother didn't even noticed that the screen protector was on!  This has definitely met my expectations and fits very well on my phone.  There's even additional space in the cut out of the protector for your camera/speakers.  One thing that I would say is that your protector can be left with many of your finger prints, so you'd have to wipe your phone off very often.  Other than that I would definitely make another purchase from this brand!
0.9861653	0.59930944	Easy to follow instructions for application and with everything you need right in the package. I have used the product for a week now and like it very much.
0.84902966	0.64484745	I needed to write a review on these screen protectors.  When I first applied it to my new iPhone 5S I was satisfied with the product.  It went on a bit easier then other screen protectors I have used and I liked the matte finish.  I would not say it prevented fingerprints but I honestly wasn't expecting it to - it did make them less noticeable though.  Two weeks went by and then one quiet evening the puppy decided the phone would make a fun chew toy.  The case was pretty much destroyed and I was not happy - the puppy quickly hid.  Then I took a closer look to determine exactly how much damage was done.  The screen protector was seriously dented and bent where it came into contact with sharp puppy teeth.  I removed it with bated breath, wiped the slobber off that had gotten under the screen protector, then blinked - once, twice, three times.  I help it under a light just to make sure I was seeing what I think I was seeing.  The entire front of the phone was undamaged.  Everywhere that screen protector had covered there was not a dent, nic, or a scratch to be found.  There were scratches and dents where the case was chewed off so I know how bad it could have been if not for the screen protector.  I am still blown away by that and since I had 2 more from the original 3 I quickly applied a fresh screen protector.  I could not be happier with this product.  Their new slogan should be &#34;Tech Armor...  It's Puppy Proof!&#34;
0.03401518	0.47798616	Looks like they are trying, but was never able to get the bubbles out.Even with the support and video the product did not do what it was supposed to.
0.98798597	0.7286678000000001	I ordered this for my daughter.  It is a great proteitve case and does the job for a great price.
0.99492186	0.7943295	Love it, you don't even know it is there. Easy to install.  Glad I got the glossy instead of matte, several people advised against the matte.
0.9981892	0.83079815	These were a great buy. Simple to install, barely notice it's there, and a great feel. I've used other manufacturers before but Tech Amor is the new standard. I highly recommend this product.
0.6217906999999999	0.63464284	This product is exactly what I was looking for.  The application is the tricky part, but it isn't any different than other dry screen protectors.  I'm using it with a Candyshell speck case, and as long as you get it nearly centered they don't touch so there isn't much if any risk of the case peeling up an edge.
0.04916355	0.41162440000000006	I was looking for a new screen protector and decided, based off of reviews, to go with Tech Armor. Out of the box I was very eager. They provided 3 protectors and the feel of them were very nice. However... A screen protector is only as good as its ability to be applied to the screen and that's where these fell short for me.By the time I was done I had gone through all 3 protectors. All had air bubbles and all had little specs of dust that stuck to the underside of the screen. Understand that I am a very meticulous person and clean my phone vigorously before application of screens and while I can maybe say one mistake was human error... 3? Maybe the sticky adhesive is too sticky and just attracts dust but after 3 attempts to apply the screen protector and failing I am returning the whole package of them.I should note that if it weren't for the bubbles and dust this protector would have been very nice, smooth feeling, however if you have a smart phone, you know that if you have a bubble all you see is a bubble.
0.99311066	0.83108467	Easy to apply and all the tools necessary are included in the packet. I slide the phone in and out of my pocket without worrying it's going to get scratched or damaged.
0.94467545	0.59932745	Great screen protector. I didn't want a screen protector because i liked the feel of the glass but decided to give this a try. I'm happy I did. This screen protector feels just like the glass. It's easy to install, no bubbles. I'm going to order one for my iPad too. Great product!!!!
0.9535639000000001	0.75008494	great screen protector. I bought the Incipio case for iPhone 5, and it came with a clear screen protector. I used that one first but it's thick and the size is a little smaller than the screen. This was my first time trying tech armor's product and it's successful.
0.9487329	0.77358377	I cant even notice the screen protector! It went on easy, i misaligned it the first time but i just peeled it off and it went on perfectly without problems the second time!
0.13214195	0.68369794	First of all I got this product not in the packaging as advertised above. It came in a dusty flimsy ziplog bag. And it didn't contain all of the items listed such as the dust removal tape. I've bought Tech Armor screen protectors before for my Nexus 7 2013 and my S4 and I can almost say this product advertised above is a fake. The cutouts are not perfectly straight or aligned. Definitely not recommended buying from this seller.
0.9608158000000001	0.7873045	i LUFF GOLDand this is a luxurious gold, without being too blingy. It has a brushed-looking texture on the back panel, kind of like the texture of bamboo. i find this delightfully ironic - gold bamboo? rare yet invasive? not sure how that works. anyways, the case fits perfectly, is sleek but not slippery, slim and minimalist looking (whilst being GOLD) with a fine lip on it so I feel comfortable putting the phone face down. I feel that I have the classiest phone in the room. i would definitely gift this or buy it again.i haven't tried out the screen protector that was included (had a screen protector on already) but will update when I switch screen protectors.
0.9306696	0.76065207	This is a great screen protector for the price.  I spent about 20 minutes prepping my iPhone 5 to get every little spec of dust off of it and then easily installed this item.  Good deal!
0.99921465	0.8840515999999999	This screen protector fit properly, was easy to apply, and is crystal clear.  Very happy with this product, I would recommend it highly.
0.98461616	0.84718406	Excellent value for your money: includes three screen protectors, squeegee card, cloth, and dust removal tape.This brand of screen protector seems to be of a higher quality than others that I've purchased before. Application went smoother than with other screen protectors, the dust removal tape was definitely a huge plus.The only downside to this was that it seemed to pick up oil quite easily and have a perpetually streaky look to it that wasn't easy to wipe off with a t-shirt like I usually do. I'm very particular about how my screen looks so I personally removed the screen protector after two weeks use. Would recommend it to others though, still a good product.Everything else was excellent though. Good company, good customer service.
0.030104429	0.5279793	I've had my iPhone for 4 weeks now, and put the Tech Armor screen protector on immediately.  Installation was easy, the fit was good, and the feel and look of the protector was great.  And for the first 3.5 weeks, I kept my phone in a pocket that didn't have anything else in it and the look of the protector remained like new.  But then on 2 occasions, for about an hour each time, I put my phone in the opposite pocket that also contained a couple keys.  The first time the screen protector received what looks like a crack around the earpiece, but since it wasn't over the display I didn't care much.  Then the second time the protector received what looked like a puncture on the middle of the screen, which created a large air bubble.  The actual screen is fine, but it's unacceptable that the protector is ruined after a month.  They are cheap, but I don't want to go through the process of installing a new protector every 4 weeks.  I kept the same screen protector on my droid for an entire year without an issue, so I'll go back to that brand of screen protector.
0.8102906999999999	0.7659682	Good price, comes with 3 screens. Be patient when peeling off the top protective layer, I couldn't get it for the life of me at first, but it will come off right. The only complaint I have is the youtube video showing you how to do it labeled the parts and steps of the screen protector differently than what was actually on the product itself.  Ex. It says peel off the layer that says peel first, well the actual screen doesn't have that label.
0.9908222	0.8479610999999999	This is easily the best screen protector I've had for any of my iphones.  Easy to put on and you can't even tell it's there once it's on.  Also well fitting so cases don't cause it to peel up around the edges.  Would definitely recommend.
0.99764025	0.896935	These matte protectors are great if you are looking to minimize glare and fingerprints, and get smoother feel on the screen.  BUT, you have to be willing to sacrifice screen clarity with those.  They made the screen look almost oily and pixelated, and the clarity of the Retina is lost.If you don't like the sound of those, try the HD clear version of these protectors - those are fantastic - very easy to apply and crystal clear.  No bubbles!I also can't say enough good things about the Tech Armor customer support - they were great.  I ordered the matte ones, and just asked them a question about the clarity.  They answered the question and even offered to send me a free HD clear set if I wasn't entirely happy, without me asking them to.  I'll buy from them again because of that.
0.34203768	0.5039908	This should be included with OtterBoxes. The flimsy cheap screen protector that came with mine was no match for this fine piece of technology.
0.9870014000000001	0.74735194	The best protector I have ever had for my iPhone. Absolutely no glare or fingerprints. I will be buying more of these. It's a must buy.
0.27892414	0.50220156	This product works just as advertised, it may help however to adjust the screen brightness of the iphone as auto brightness may cause visibility to be slightly different
0.995527	0.81294596	Very easy to install, very well thought process. Everything is clearly labeled, thorough walk-through. Touchscreen remains responsive, shield is crystal-clear.
0.6911789	0.627731	Got what I expected and delivered very quickly. Even with the instructions screen protector is difficult to apply without getting air bubble or fuzzies on the sticky side.
0.3622537	0.52151775	It works right away and it really is 360 Privacy Protection. I recommend this product to anyone, you won't be upset.
0.1429818	0.4952682	peels off ot really what i thought it would be. its does not mesh well with my phone protector. no
0.9762951999999999	0.78699934	Carefully packaged with 3 anti glare cover. Easily to apply with no bubbling look and feel great. Buy the Tech Amor protectors!
0.45389540000000006	0.67095995	This screen protector definitely makes the screen look nice and crystal clear. However, its a bit hard to put on after using all 3 that came in the package I still have bubbles showing
0.9981888000000001	0.86839676	Screen protectors were not the ones I meant to order since the matte finish slightly degrades the retina display image but the are of high quality with precise cutouts. I reordered the HD clear version and can't wait for those to come in the mail. I also got their Frosted Black case and ot's awesome. Tech Armor is such a joy to work with! They're all about ensuring the customer is satisifed. I will always buy Tech Armor from now on! Great quality at great price!
0.87567323	0.7953292	This screen protector was very easy to apply works well. I'm not a huge fan of how thick it is,however, it is not a problem. I did buy 2 more for the iPhone 4 rather than the 5 for my friends and the screen quality on theirs seems to be better. It does take away from the screen quality alittle bit. It's not a huge deal completely worth it. All three of us love it! Also I wouldn't buy this is you have a life proof case. It works it just makes your screen less responsive and the home button is harder to push.
0.99752736	0.76979125	For once, I have a screen protector on my iphone with no bubbles.  Love it.  Looks great.  I definitely recommend this product.
0.22682329999999998	0.5366608	I messed up on the first 3 tries and asked tec armor if they could send me new ones. They did right away!
0.99698913	0.7773335	This is a good screen protector and reduces the glare so it Is easier to read in outside. I like the matte feel. Tech Armor is great to deal with if you have ny issues. I recommend watching their video before you apply.
0.6779986	0.60288465	When I first got my iPhone 5, there were few accessories available.  I ended up buying a different screen protector that required cutting it to fit the screen - over time it became scratched.  I decided to buy this screen protector and what a difference!  Fits the screen out of the package and no scratches so far!  Definitely recommend!
0.97628284	0.82844007	Great screen protector. After a day or two the residual film wore off now I can't even tell a screen protector is on my iPhone. A tip on installation, I put the tech armor on my phone underneath my stove hood vent to have dust drawn up, not one speck of dust got under my screen protector. Did this for both my wife's and my iPhone.
0.8987098	0.66733587	follow the direction and time-honored practices. clean your phone well. then use the tape they have. it is golden. never throw it out. it is the best way to remove dust from electronic surfaces and prep them for screen protectors. when applying the protection film, go slowly. get the bubbles out along the way. i used a credit card because i could get more even pressure with it.my husband applied one to his phone and i to my phone. he was much less patient with applying it. his had bubbles (not a bad amount) and he had decided not to use it. then he saw mine... no bubbles... and asked me to apply his. after using the tape on both the protection film and his phone i was able to apply the same film to his without bubbles. do not underestimate the importance of going slowly and deliberately.
0.9614914000000001	0.681137	I ordered these and they were so easy to install and they work great.  Will never order anything any different
0.9643799999999999	0.5372763	So I had already written a review because I had issues with bubbling and I figured I would give it three stars and let it be. With in 1hr I was contacted and offered multiple tips and instructions on how to avoid the issue in the future and also told that a replacement would be sent free of charge! What a great company, and they obviously care about customer satisfaction. I strongly urge anyone interested in this product to try it out. They are sure to make sure you are satisfied. Thanks!!!
0.98045003	0.7862873	I have been buying screen protectors for my iPhones on Amazon since my first iPhone. These are THE best screen protectors I have ever used! Very easy to put on and I absolutely NO annoying little air bubbles on my screens! I peeled back only the bottom of the protector and placed it around the home button. Then I used the handy card to press the screen protector to the iPhone while peeling the rest of the screen protector bit by bit. Took me half the time to put on than any other!
0.96275353	0.79555523	This was easy to install and overall works great.  My ony complaint is that the cover is constantly streaked with fingerprints etc and I have to clean it several times a day.  The screen does what it says it does but I will be getting a new smudge proof screen soon to replace it.
0.14598131	0.6674960999999999	I've been using these for about four months now. I really like them when they are on the phone but they started to peel off and curl in the corners.
0.98472315	0.8378367	i tried the tech armor HD and a couple others for my iphone5, and to me this is the best screen protector. i prefer the matte for its fingerprint fighting aspect and i dont find that it diminishes the screen clarity or function at all. at this price, if you are looking i would try this. fits well, simple installation.
0.44493059999999995	0.5500874	"This was the most responsive screen protector I've used and the least noticeable after installation.Still, it tool two screen protectors to install as the first one ""found"" dust motes where there shouldn't have been any as I cleared the screen thoroughly but somehow they were there.Removing the first screen left all kinds of marks and dents so it became unusable.However, even that did not make me feel any the less worse from having ordered this product.I would definitely recommend it and the vendor.Great buying experience. Definitely will order again"
0.9996939	0.7622036999999999	This is the.best screen protector I've ever bought! Got it for my iPhone 5 and I couldn't believe the clarity! I'm very happy with thais product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Love love love!
0.99304664	0.7484291999999999	This was very easy to apply. It protects very well against scratches in my bag. My phone is still in great condition
0.98731935	0.8268943999999999	They fit well, are easy to apply, hold up well since they do not lift at corners and are as described.I would recommend.
0.53827125	0.72217405	I would say that there are several pros and cons:PROS:No bubblesResists fingerprintsI was able to use one screen protector and can save the other 2 if necessary.CONS:It must have taken me 100 tries to get the cover on properly.  It was very difficult to align - for example, I had a hard time getting all 3 holes to fit with the home button, camera, and speaker.  If two fit perfectly, one did not.It was also very easy for me to get dust on the phone and the adhesive side of the screen protector, the more time I spent readjusting the screen protector.  I was pretty much exhausted when I was finished.The screen colors are more washed out, but this is because of the anti-glare properties.This is probably a rare compliant, but I absolutely cannot stand the sensation of the protector.  When I swipe my fingers across the surface, I have the irritating feeling similar to fingernails scraping across a chalkboard.  I wonder why no one else has written about this in the reviews that I have read.I completely used up the provided tape - I cut it in half, and I have tons of lint/dust all over the sticky side.Overall, I would give the product 4 out of 5 stars.My next question is - is there a better product that would provide more clarity and have a smooth and slick surface?  I would prefer this over the anti-glare properties and reduced fingerprinting.  Perhaps the HD screen protector is the answer for my preferences.
0.5727920999999999	0.6872455	The package came as they said it would, 3 to a pack. I like the feel of these vs the other protectors but putting it on is a little bit of a pain (as a lot of them are). In this case though, the process starts from the home button upwards, making it a little more tricky to line up since there's less points of reference to line up from...at least there are three to a pack.
0.7733669	0.6470419	First of all, I would suggest reading the enclosed instructions and even watching the online video before applying this screen protector. It took me 2 tries to get my screen protector on so that it looks right. The first time I had some air bubbles that I just couldn't get out so I had to throw it away. With the second one I was able to get all the bubbles out except for some on the edges, but my phone case covers them up. I had a hard time lining it up straight, I was probably a little too anal about it. Now that it's on, I can't even tell I have a screen protector. Hopefully, by the time I have to apply the next one, I'll be a pro. I would recommend this product.
0.9960860999999999	0.7849904999999999	If you apply it correctly and have a little patience to line it up just right this is an amazing screen protector for the price.Best way to ensure a dust free zone in opinion:After you take a hot shower and the bathroom is all steamy all the dust particles in the air are weighed down by moisture, giving you the perfect setting to apply your screen protector. Works like a charm!
0.9591484	0.74392927	I used the &#34;clean the screen and install under the range hood&#34; method and no dust!  I don't even notice that it is on.  I don't like the smudge free ones, so this virtually disappears.  Still have to clean it - but it works!
0.9939084999999999	0.8175163000000001	You cannot beat this product for the price. They are clear, easy to apply, and fit the iPhone 5 perfectly. Significantly better than some other imitators on the market.
0.025397241	0.5223652	I got these for the iphone 5 and was very unlucky in putting them on. The first one I tried, the areas around the home-button on the phone refused to get rid of its bubbles. I took it off and tried reapplying it, but after a few curses and dropping the protector it got covered in fuzz and I couldn't put it on the phone anymore. The second one I tried, there's an entire area on the right-side edge of the screen that refuses to stay down! I put the protector on the phone without any problems, so there wasn't anything on the sticky side of the protector to make it not stay on the phone screen.The entire area of the right side of my phone screen is bothering me because the screen protector always lifts itself off of it. I should replace it with the third one, but then again it's the last one.  Tech Armor should have put more protectors in the packaging honestly, since these are so easy to mess and up have to replace.
0.99687123	0.75302273	This looks very sleek yet solid, and with just how professional tech armor is, I believe I cAn certainly count on the durability and the unlimited for which my iPhone will have.Thanks Tech Armor
0.9558431999999999	0.75269127	Good screen protector. Nice, clear instructions. I was able to properly apply this to my phone on the second attempt. Worked so well that it really isn't noticeable I have a screen protector at all.
0.94028276	0.7510888000000001	Took two tries to get it placed perfectly onto my iPhone 5, but once i got it in I was extremely happy with the product. When my phone is active, I can't even tell I have a screen protector on and it feels good to the touch. It's exactly what I wanted. It doesnt hide the smudges but whatever, I can just wipe those off with a cloth when it gets too annoying.One thing I wasn't happy with was the fact that I had to throw the first protector away because i had to take it off so many times during the initial application. The other protector it came with was also slightly scratched. BUT I contacted customer service and they sent a replacement right away. Really great customer service makes up for a lot of things because you know your concerns will be taken seriously if you have a problem with the product.
0.87472916	0.63746643	I originally bought the matte screen protector but I hated how the screen looked &#34;fuzzy&#34;. I installed this and can't even tell I have a screen protector! It even comes with pieces of &#34;tape&#34; to lift screen protector once installed to remove trapped dust particles.  So far so good.
0.9939618	0.7425178000000001	The installation instruction video was clear and easy to follow. The product was easy to apply the first time around. I look forward to using the screen protector with my new phone. Overall I think this is a wise investment.
0.9895430000000001	0.8015479	This is a screen protector I highly recommend!  Everything you need to successfully apply the screen protector comes in this kit.  However, I used an eye glasses cleaner to lightly spray on the phone after removing any lint/dust, then applied the screen protection and &#34;squeegeed&#34; the bubbles out. Perfect.
0.91777456	0.7173033000000001	I ordered this product for the phone which I installed without a hitch. I then ordered another protector for a different device. This installation had issues. Tech Armor contacted me even before I had an issue. When I explained the problem they were responsive and quick to fix the issue.
0.9769459	0.8342870000000001	I was convinced to go with these covers for my new iPhone 5 based on the reviews and what seemed like great customer service.  I found them pretty easy to put on the phone and you get three covers, so it is a great value.  I would certainly recommend these screen covers and would certainly buy them again.  However, since there are three of them in the package and they have a lifetime guarantee, I might never have to.No change in screen clarity with them on and it actually seems to improve the touchscreen.
0.09489393	0.46433702	you can still easily see what the pictures are and can easily read large fonts from the side, this thing is useless.
0.04681799	0.5813522	Apple employee applied both films for me with expertise, but film picks up scratches easily and needs replacement every couple of months.  Disappointing.
0.8850039000000001	0.6935833	I noticed a hairline scratch on my 6-month old iphone 5--hardly noticeable, but I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again.  Went to Amazon, of course, and found the Tech Armor 3-pack:  highly rated & a great price.  P.S.  had a question after I received them & the customer service team got back to me with a personal response within a few hours.
0.9972110999999999	0.77390957	It is sleek and nice. I am very happy with this produt. It fits well to my phone. I have got the black one and it looks great.Woderful product.
0.96202886	0.8152484	This product is excellent. I would have rated it 5 stars had it been a little easier to install. The directions were simple and specific...I just had a hard time lining up the edges so it went on completely straight. The card that comes with it to use to help push out air bubbles was pretty much worthless. I found much better success just using my thumbs and letting the protector sheet slide down easily from one side to the other...all while pushing air bubbles out manually. After the install...the protector itself is spectacular. It looks and feels just like the original glass. I would highly recommend this screen protector!
0.3348363	0.6563641	I was going to wait and see if the third cover was any better than the first two but 2 strikes and your out with me.The covers both went on great and easy.  No bubbles no spots.Then by day 2 of each one the edges began to come up.  I can only recommend this to people who have covers that completely hold down the edge like an otterbox.  For those of us who don't have that type,  no goodI will be calling for a refund
0.9882859	0.7951351999999999	I've owned and used multiple screen protectors for multiple devices, for the HD quality the iPhone 5 offers which I current use, this particular screen protector I believe is a great match and improves the protection while maintaining the HD quality the iPhone 5 boasts.
0.9641177	0.78788257	A really nice protective cover for the screen. It was very easy to put on with very few air bubbles
0.06884408	0.23503125	I followed the directions to the &#34;t&#34;. I could not figure out a way to apply the film without numerous bubbles even watching the tutorial provided by Tech Armor. I have purchased different products in the past for previous generation IPHONES and had no problem applying.  I can't figure out how anyone could apply and not have bubbles
0.9902655999999999	0.8080425	LOVE that these are matte, and not shiny like the others! So nice to not have sun glare, would def. recommend these. so far they've done their job as well.
0.98321176	0.83207345	Tried alot of these, and many of them just start to peel off the edges (Belkin).This one was easy to apply.  Dust remover and bubble scrapper helpful.Stays in place well, no bubbles, absolutely no complaints.
0.20532799	0.38892284	I had too much trouble getting this on correctly (even though I watched the videos, etc.).  Part of the problem is they do not include enough of the stickers to remove dust (the stickers are also used to lift the side of the screen protector so you can get another sticker on the glass to remove any dust discovered after the first attempt to apply the screen protector).At a minimum, another two sets of stickers should be included.  (I ended up discarding two screens because I did not have enough stickers to remove the dust that tends to sabotages installations--so I had to buy a second package to try again).
0.94132006	0.81344783	I was presently surprised at how easy the install was and the protector disappears on the iPhone when you pull the upper plastic off. Very nice! The only thing I was surprised to see and don't care for is that the protecter does not cover all around the home button, it leaves the bottom below the button exposed. Otherwise this is the best screen protector on the market at a great price!
0.91485345	0.804083	I purchased the Tech Armor screen protectors for my iPhone 5 after the cheap ones I got from Monoprice ended up scratching very easily after only a couple of weeks. If you've never used this type of screen protector, patience and following the instructions are your friends. It's very easy to get dust and bubbles under this type  of protector so a little diligence and patience will pay off.The fit of the Tech Armor protectors are spot on. I used a method to install my shield based on the suggestion of another reviewer and that is to line up the shield without removing the backing and put a small piece of scotch tape on one side to maintain that alignment. Clean all dust and proceed as the instructions suggest and my first shield went on flawlessly with no bubbles.For the price, I feel these are the best value. The HD clear shields do not hinder the look of the iPhones gorgeous display and you don't even know it's installed. I've only had it on for a couple of days now so I can't attest to the durability but I'll try to remember to come back and update this review after a while.
0.9745549000000001	0.782313	This was a fantastic product that came quickly and was easy to apply.  It comes with a cardboard &#34;credit card&#34; to help remove air bubbles.  Once it was applied it was hard to notice at all on the phone.
0.9992268	0.7870401	My 12 year old son was able to place these on his phone himself, neatly and efficiently and the price is excellent.  Highly recommended
0.40665403	0.34083858	I will never buy an anti glare version again lets you view your phone as it was meant to be seen!!
0.6354772	0.6452334	Good protection, easy to apply  Not as nice as the glass screen but pretty goog, shows finger marks more than glas screen
0.95006835	0.7581373	I have no issues with this screen protector, it works well and is a good price. My only issue is the description pretty clearly says it comes with instructions. Mine came in a plastic baggie with no instructions of any kind.
0.110402346	0.43552756	No matter how careful I was, following the instructions diligently -- cloth wipe, stickers, etc -- I always got bubbles I couldn't remove. More than one. No one wants a screen with white circles on it, so I threw this out.
0.55687815	0.70734847	Please read the updates to this Review and it will explain why I gave 5 stars.I followed the instructions the sent with the protectors. I washed my hands, cleaned the phone with the cloth (this was after I removed the plastic from a new phone so it was clean to begin with), and used the dust removal tape. I pealed the first layer off and placed it on the phone and there were several bits of grit under the protector. I tried to gently lift the protector to remove the grit but this only ruined the protector. I figured I just messed up and tried it again...same thing. I ended scrapping the whole thing. The only thing I can figure out is the film had the grit already on it. Whatever the reason, it was a complete waste of money!Save yourself the trouble and get something else.Update: Tech Armor promptly contacted me to send replacements. While they may be difficult to install, the company behind this product seems to stand behind their product. The sent out replacements right away. I will update this review further when I receive the replacements. I don't feel a company that concerned with keeping customers, should get the review I gave them.Last Update: I originally was very upset with the difficulty of installing these protectors. upon writing this review, Tech Armor responded and promptly sent out replacements. On their behalf, I live in Minnesota and we have had below normal temperatures resulting in arid conditions within my heated house. I really believe this made a difference with dust during the installation. This may have been the cause of my problems.These protectors may be difficult to install but the way Tech Armor stands behind them makes it a win-win situation for the customer. They say on well, and are tough when the installation is complete, and if you don't get any dust in the installation, impossible to notice on the phone.This company really impressed me with their proactive nature. I recommend this product and this company. It's a one time purchase, because Tech Armor will see to it that you are happy!
0.53328705	0.68183196	I've done a bunch of these on different items, phones, ipads etc.  Product is about the same as most, price is allot better than buying in a store.  Only thing I found is that the first one I grabbed was not the same texture as the other ones, it was stickier on both sides, I was unable to use that one, the other two were fine and that is all I needed.
0.71605706	0.6767143	The top holes seem to be a little off, but nothing that isn't usable. It could also be my application. Make sure you watch the installation video they have on their website as it will save you from getting hair/dust caught under the screen protector. I would order these again if I needed to. Great product.
0.8757299999999999	0.67203933	The screen protector fits my iphone 5 perfectly.  Feels like it is not there. Messed up my first attempt but good thing it comes in 3s.
0.0058801174	0.45228437	My husband used all three that came in the package and was not able to get the bubbles out. Simply horrible
0.3510986	0.6964779000000001	The only down side to this product is that it reduces the screen quality. I didn't have a face cover for a week between buying the phone and getting the screen protectors delivered. I got used to the crisp, high quality screen display. After putting the screen protector on it got noticeably worse, but I got used to it. You just have to decide if you'd rather have great, glassy screen quality or anti-glare and anti-finger print. Note: the cut out for the &#34;home&#34; button is a circle, not a U as I think one review mentioned. Also, the line cut out for the ear speaker isn't off center to expose the sensor, the sensor is covered by the screen protector and it works great. The forward facing camera also has a little hole cut out.
0.97614723	0.77299917	This screen protector was easy enough to put on and I was really surprised that it turns out like the more expensive ones you usually have to squeegee on with water or solution. It feels great to the touch too! If I ever have to replace it, this is the brand I'll be seeking out.
0.9698508	0.7319720999999999	This was easy to install and serves it purpose. My complaint is that there is always a greasy residue on the surface. I am considering just removing and going without a screen protector.
0.8616362	0.83495057	The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish it came with 2 sheets to protect the screen protector with a 2nd tab (like it is with the clear protectors).  I realize this is difficult because the one sided matte finish probably doesn't allow for a 2nd protective sheet to adhere to the matte side.  But this makes it a little more difficult to apply than the clear protectors because after removing the protective sheet, there is nothing to hold onto but the protector itself which can introduce dust and debris onto the screen.  It also comes with a microfiber cloth to remove dust and a squeegee to remove any bubbles.  The key is to avoid touching the screen protector itself and to keep the screen as clean as possible before application. I always clean my screen with some Windex first and then run over it with the microfiber cloth. The matte protectors are thicker than the clear protectors which make them less flexible than the clear protectors.  Use the home button as a guide.  I used a piece of tape as a tab to lift up the screen protector and then more tape to remove dust or debris which had gotten in between the screen and protector - this step is key to a smooth application.  What's good about this brand is that the screen protector is just a shy smaller than the screen itself so if you're putting on a TPU case which snugly covers the phone, the case won't get caught under the screen protector at the corners and ruin it.  The matte finish is nice - no fingerprints and no glare!  The matte finish on the screen protector does result in a small brushing sound when you run your fingers over it but you get used to the sound and the feel after awhile.
0.994102	0.80632913	Very happy with this screen protector. It was easy to install  and does what it is supposed to. Would recommend!
0.9876981	0.75566936	Screens were very easy to put on the phone (just got the iphone 5 yesterday).  Delivery was fast and items arrived in perfect condition.  Unforutnatley because I've had the screens on for less than a day I can't really give much more feedback than that :)
0.6972957	0.72582847	I received the 3-pack of these screen protectors very shortly after I ordered them.  They were very easy to apply.  I made a mistake and got a speck of dust under the screen on my first try; it was definitely still usable but annoying.  I tried again and applied a new screen protector.  Perfect!  So far this screen protector has been working fine.  The HD Retina display still comes through.  The protector covers the phone.  There are no issues with it coming off or unsticking.I understand that it is difficult to put ANY type of screen protector on.  These are no exception but given that they are so inexpensive (compared to similar screen protectors that I've seen) it's fine if you mess one up in the application process.  Also, the non-sticky side has a protective cover so if you use your nail or the included card to push out the air bubbles you don't scratch the actual screen protector, only the cover.  (This sounds confusing.  What it means is that the actual screen protector is encased in a top and bottom layer which you remove during the application process.  This is different from other screen protectors that I've used.)
0.07528624	0.4929237	I chose this produce to prevent scratching on my phone screen. Did not like it very much compared to another brand because the writing on the tabs  which indicate which side to remove first was too small and I pulled off the wrong side first thus causing the film to get fingerprints on it.I tossed the first film and used the second one but for some reason, the size of the film was off a bit and therefore the holes did not line up.
0.9933443000000001	0.80499595	I purchased this item immediately after getting my iPhone 5. It arrived neatly packaged and included step by step directions. I followed the directions exactly and had no problems getting the screen protector on my iPhone 5. Now that's in place it's essentially invisible, there are no lines and the protector causes no viewing problems on the screen. When I ordered the item I noticed that some people had had problems putting the protector in place without there being bubbles from lint. I put mine on in a very well lit bathroom and took a lot of time to make sure everything lined up correctly and that the screen was lint free. I may have taken more time and precaution than needed, but the result was a perfect, protected display.
0.7224933000000001	0.7306465	Easy install. Love the Matte & Anti-glare. Bad thing is I keep my phone and keys in the same pocket in my purse, my keys put a tiny divot in the screen protector... :/ Of course, this happened on the 3rd day I had the protector on. Previously, I had the screen protector that comes with the otter box., which I had on for a little over a year, and I never had this problem. I only replaced because the corner started peeling off. I am a little disappointed because I thought these would last a little longer without coming off or &#34;denting&#34;.
0.16534516	0.52933437	It's thick and poorly made. The surface reduce the brightness and resolution of the screen a lot, I mean, A LOT! I don't want to sacrifice my using experience only for protecting the screen. The most important thing is, it doesn't even fit!
0.010647625	0.45989248	These don't line up well.  At all.  They're awful.  If you line up the cut out at the bottom, the cutout on the top is in the middle of the camera.  Impossible.
0.98488235	0.8170536999999999	Great product and does what it claims at a really reasonable price.  I followed the link to the &#34;installation&#34; video, which seemed silly at first, but it was genuinely helpful.  I would highly recommend this screen protector!
0.92324734	0.8115002	The last time I put a screen protector on my phone (not this brand), it took me three tries and even my third attempt didn't look the greatest.  When I put the first Tech Armor on, it literally took me 3 minutes, and it went on flawlessly.  You can't even tell there's anything on the phone, and I love the way my fingers glide across the screen.  Now I still have two backups in case the first gets scratched.  Highly recommended.
0.46602842	0.5482005	There is nothing worse than having a new expensive toy than having a ton of scratches all over the screen. This works great at what it's designed to do.
0.99613553	0.7670172	Best screen protector ever. Love the feel of it and it is just very smooth to the touch - great feeling.
0.03565666	0.48315924	We ordered these based on a search for an anti-glare product, which it turns out, these arent.  Now that I look back it doesnt actually say it in the title, so shame on me for not reading- but was definitly tricked by someone in the search process.  No different then any other product as far as application, lint, etc.  Good price for 3.
0.025708198999999998	0.6209253	They are ok. The plastic tab you use to pull off the protective plastic is really glued on and leaves glue marks when you remove.
0.8243835999999999	0.6438577	We needed something for our new iPhone 5s and this worked. It was a little tricky to put on but ultimately we did it and it was worth it.
0.38667965	0.5035343	I was pretty impressed by the quality of the item for the price and the fast shipping, but was unable to apply the screen protectors without bubbles. I followed the instructions, but unfortunately, wasn't able to do it in three tries. I was able to do it for my old iphone 4s with a matte screen protector from another company (forgot which one) in the past, but it could just be my fault this time. Anyway, I actually didn't like how this matte screen protector distorted the clarity of the iphone anyway so next time I'll probably try with a clear screen protector. Live and learn.
0.9967998	0.7995515000000001	Easy to understand instructions.  Pack came with everything I needed to get this screen protector on with ease.  I would definitely purchase products from Tech Armor again.
0.074397355	0.48015162	After reading such great reviews, I decided to purchase this item.I just received this product in the mail today, VERY EXCITED to put it on my phone.I follow instructions that it comes with and the end result, I have tiny little bubbles everywhere even after trying to push them out for 10 mins & it's really annoying. I am not happy at ALL! (& yes I used all 3!)I will not purchase another product from this company again.
0.9922595999999999	0.8068345	The application was so easy and it is VERY clear. It comes with 3 which is great in case there are ever any signs of wear and tear. Hopefully, I won't need to use the others.
0.93055314	0.73189664	Works great and I got it in 2 days!!!!!! No one an see what I'm writing and seriously it just works! Get it! You won't regret it!!
0.9536034999999999	0.77042174	Let me just say, thank goodness there were three of these in the package, because I always have a difficult time applying them correctly. I ended up having to remove the first one and put a second one on solely because the first one wasn't applied straight, and after eight hours of use was beginning to bubble up at the corner.Anyway, aside from that, these things are great. No loss whatsoever of the iPhone's amazing Retina display. Also, once you touch the screen a few times--get a little oil on it--it feels fine and not strange, as with some screen protectors.Overall, I highly recommend these screen protectors.
0.9937575000000001	0.84905875	exactly what I wanted, and goes on very easily. barely any bubbles and I put it on in 5 minutes! the tape that comes with this is super helpful to remove any dust and now it's perfect.
0.4184655	0.65640503	The privacy film started peeling off near the home screen button after 4-5 months use. I gave the product 3 star since it does work as it is advertised. Just not too crazy about the product quality!------This review is revised on May 11, 2013-------The company contacted me and sent a replacement after my first review in April. I'd appreciate that the management took extra step to keep their promise about lifetime warranty. After installing the new privacy screen, I noticed this new screen has much better improved compared to what I had before. The grid line is now gone. I can now check e-mail on the phone easier without compromising the privacy I need in public. Extra dust removal screen is a plus! No screen bubble after installing!!!
0.94575566	0.74896836	Better than the one that came with the otter box.  It went on much easier. The screen is still very clear.
0.9952283000000002	0.83824706	I am in love with these screen protectors. I have had an iPhone since Gen 1 and I have always put on screen protectors. Usually they have a few bubbles that I can't get out or they get a hair underneath it or a smudge and then I spend like 30 minutes trying to get it perfect. Not the case this the tech armor. It went on perfect the first time without a problem and I had no trouble aligning it or getting the air bubbles out. The shipping was fast as well. I will definitely be ordering these again when I upgrade.
0.87811935	0.7233843000000001	UpdateSo I've had this protector on my screen for about a year, and it only just started peeling off. So I took the whole thing off to replace. WHOA. I didn't realize my iPhone 5 had such a nice screen. I was wrong with my first review. This really does mess with the image quality. Really.I still give it 4 stars because it is legitimately matte, no finger prints, has lasted well, and is inexpensive. But now that I know what quality I've been missing, I can't go back. :(****No more shiny screens for me! Apply the screen protector was as easy/difficult as any other screen protect I've used. I don't feel that it messes with the quality of whatever i'm looking at on the screen. It's neat. I recommend it!
0.8911599	0.6784206	It is what I am looking for and I am satisfied with it.There is no more finger print and no more reflection outside.I like it!!
0.99771154	0.80465037	"This is hands down the best screen protector I've used ever. I've tried many other ones before that claimed to be ""HD"" and there would always be something that made the screen look weird. So I usually just pass on screen protectors since I want the retina screen to be perfect. Well now I can have my cake and eat it too!! The installation process is very simple they give you three protectors in the pack, and instructions which were easy to follow. I have already ordered this product twice just because of how amazing it is. I always like to brag to people look at my screen and they usually just think its just a regular retina screen, but when I tell them there is a screen protector on they're in shock and instantly want one."
0.98920405	0.8064685	Got here a day early and I have prime...Fastest item I have ever got. Went on pretty easy, I got two little dust particles, but you can barely notice them, and I'm pretty anal about bubbles, dust, etc. Try to apply the protector in a clean area with some sort of ventilation.Would buy again and you can't beat the price! Don't buy those $30 dollar screen protectors at the store, buy this!
0.9300785	0.8149241	I've just bought my second package of these screen protectors and put it in a drawer in case I need to replace my current Tech Armor protector but it may be a while because they hold up exceptionally well to moisture (sweat), objects that tend to scratch most other screen protectors, and normal wear and tear.  Like all of these things, it's a bear to get it on right without a few specks of dust messing up the perfect seal but once applied you can count on not having to replace the thing for many months.
0.9972366	0.8657085999999999	The screen protector is great!  It fits perfectly and was easy to install, with no bubbles.  I have a case, but the protector is thin enough than the case still fits. The matte finish was just what I was looking for, as it prevents fingerprints.  The resolution is affected, but it always is with screen protectors.  Overall a great product, and a great value, considering this was a 3-pack.
0.96957207	0.7798931	i'll caveat this with the fact that i had to use all three screens before i got it right, but after i did on the third try, it is perfect.i'm pretty anal, so not only could i have zero imperfections on the screen, it had to align perfectly from top to bottom, side to side.  this is partly why it took three tries.i have to say though, of all the screens i've had to date, this has been the best fitting, clearest and easiest to put on (yes, it took me three tries, but once i actually learned how to use scotch tape to lift and remove captured dust, it was actually really easy the third time).  some may say that that makes it difficult to apply, but i argue that it would have taken an anal person like me just as long, if not longer to apply any other screen perfectly.i recommended this to my sister and will be helping her apply it since i've learned how to do it easily.
0.31120953	0.5693053000000001	Its grt one in this price considering 3 in quantity. Only issue i couldnt make out from description that it doesnt include one for the back
0.9860841	0.6875663000000001	Application easy and bubble free on first application. Would def buy again and have bought a pack for my brother who appreciated the high quality protector as well.
0.9986461	0.85343015	Went on easy without any bubbles, great protection and scratch resistant, cleans easy.  I would recommend this product to anyone
0.98247945	0.7195824000000001	I love this screen protector!  It was so e-z to put on i didnt get a single bubble in the screen first time i tried. My friend got ripped off by our local radio shack and paid 20 dollhairs (dollars) for his protector an failed trying to put it on. I paid like 7 bucks for 3 and it went on perfect. Im even using it right now. I fricken love this thing and i would recommend it to anyone.
0.91089773	0.6140663000000001	This screen protector is one of the best I've ever bought I went though one of them trying to get it on, so now I have one left.  The reason I bought this product is because my last screen protector that I had for 2 Months turned BLUE from my jeans when putting my phone in my pocket, I have yet to experience any fading on the white iPhone 5 with this protector!  Overall excellent product!!
0.8065243000000001	0.7684585	Very smooth screen and the anti-particle sticker that comesWith it makes it very easy to apply a protector without flaw
0.9592259	0.49924840000000004	great protecter and it was cheap !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thank u!  its a good product! very satisfied with it yay . !
0.9876929	0.86770815	Easy to apply.  This is the first screen protector I was able to put on with no bubbles or dust underneath.  The Retina display on my iPhone 5 is very sharp and clear.  It is almost like I have nothing covering the screen at all.  The price of this product is extremely reasonable.  I've purchased other screen protectors at much higher prices and the quality was definitely not as good as Tech Armor.  I would recommend this product to everyone!I just want to add that the only complaint I have about this product is the cloth it comes with to wipe off your screen before applying.  It was creating A LOT of dust on the screen and was really annoying.
0.9721129000000001	0.7064314	This protector is great!! They go on super easy! I got one small air bubble that cant come out, but other then that the protector is really clear and great!! :)
0.37453824	0.25815913	I thought it would be difficult to place, didn't watch the how too video but its pretty much self explanatory. I did appreciate the &#34;dust&#34; tape remover.I would def recommend it to anyone.
0.6369234	0.6799653	Easy to apply and hardly any bubbles the first time! I prefer the anti-glare so that I wouldn't be bothered by fingerprints.
0.99701625	0.80618894	Easy to apply with the included 'tools'.  Love the anti-glare, their are no fingerprints either.  Phone still has perfect touch response
0.9970454	0.7961398000000001	I have purchased some pretty crappy screen protectors in the past for a higher price and this is by far the best one I have purchased- and it was cheaper! It comes with 3 beautiful matte protectors and instructions on how to apply the screen protector to your iPhone; however, I recommend looking up the You Tube video.Great product and great price! Buy it now.
0.9618359000000001	0.7710311	i've had other privacy screens in the past that make it completely black when in the sun or make it very difficult to see head on.  this one works perfectly and i couldnt be any happier with it!
0.81571555	0.6892560000000001	I was not disappointed with this product at all. I was afraid that I would mess up the screen protector with my first try, I did great. All except for removing the second step of film. I almost had to leave it on. I'm pretty sure that was just me. I will probably be using Tech Armor screen protectors as long as I can. I still have two and the one I have on now is holding up extremely well.
0.2579694	0.4732509	The case is really thin but sturdy. Personally I prefer the slim look it gives the phone. Other bulky cases make it hard to put in your pocket. This case is not sticky and does not pick up dirt.
0.008997798000000001	0.32432842	Didn't work with my Otter Box iPhone 5 cover. Disappointing. I won't be sending it back. Probably just give them to a friend.
0.99953926	0.8142174	Great product, it is exactly as described. Fit perfectly, and installation was a piece of cake! I would definitely recommend.
0.99150264	0.7846439000000001	Great quality screen protector it's one of the best I've gotten so far, and the price was excellent for three instead of buying one for over 20 at walmart.
0.9843135000000001	0.8273593000000001	Very good!! Only prob is the cut out doesnt exactly match on the camera and top speaker section ... Very durable though! I buy these because I wear diamonds in my ear :)I would do business with them again and they are very fast on shipping!
0.9876698	0.65355664	It was a perfect screen protector for my iphone 5. Easy to install. I ordered the matte, next time i will order the glossy one. Shipping was fast.
0.9854033999999999	0.7130095000000001	Wonderful screen protectors. I received them in a timely fashion and have not had any issues with them in the past four months that I have used them. Love it!
0.9819517	0.728276	The film is quite durable and scratch resistant. The surface remains very smooth on my iphone. The application is straightforward but the only challenge is to align it well when applying it. The method of application could be improved to ensure perfect alignment.
0.51030874	0.5533483	"They're really hard to install for the ""regular Joe"", or in this case, my wife. She followed the instructions but after 10 minutes, the case just wouldn't align and install right. I had to install the 3rd that comes in the pack and even after the proper instructions, it still has some stubborn bubbles.I installed mine just fine. It has 2 bubbles that just won't seem to go away after the install.The parts that did stick to the screen look good. The parts that have the bubbles aren't that noticeable IF and only as long as you raise your screen's brightness all the way up."
0.9974236999999999	0.77560496	Plain and simple. pack of 3 good quality screen savers. my wife and i both have iphone 5 and they went on easy. fast delivery. great price on a great product.
0.99799216	0.8211421999999998	Lifetime warranty on these just makes them that much better. I got a perfect application on my first try and it has been holding up extremely well. Have a lot of love for this company and have bought plenty of other protectors from them.
0.99665517	0.85675144	Instructions are clearly written and easy to follow. This is the first screen protector I've been happy with. Nicely made and packaged. This is a no-brainer to protect your phone's display.
0.5220667999999999	0.48355526	I like the product. I did notice that the first pack did not line up but I made due. It is the way the top was cut. But one can't tell there is a screen protector on my phone. I usually use acase but the reviews were better for tech armor.
0.9567174	0.7821955	These install great iif you read the directions that comes with them. I installed one before reading the directions, realized I did it wrong and installed another one, which turned out way better and is still perfect almost 3 months later
0.76410973	0.6989418000000001	Love the matte finish. Didn't take away from graphics. I followed instructions & no problem on first try. Tiny bubble pushed out by tool supplied.
0.045585573	0.57246417	Ordered these clear screen protectors and I wasn't pleased by the condition of these films once received. One film appeared to be OK and the other two showed signs of scratches/lint. The film does look high quality but the condition I received these in are unacceptable and I'm not happy with my purchase.
0.9994966000000001	0.8155403	These are a great value and include everything you need to apply them perfectly. The package includes a cloth for wiping and a little card for pushing out bubbles. And the price is great. Cover works exactly as advertised. Shipping was super quick.
0.7863455	0.6976423	The screen protector is like a case protector for the iPhone - it is a necessary evil.  I would prefer to not use it, but my job forces me to have a screen protector in place.  I was impressed with the installation.  The company has made it very easy.  The instructions to use the included cloth with the cardboard piece that smooths out the screen protector was very helpful.  However, the screen protector still diminishes the beauty of the retina display, but it is an acceptable trade-off.  I think that the display with the screen protector on my iPhone 5 is still better than the display on my iPhone 4S, but it is not as beautiful as the display on the iPhone 5 without a screen protector in place.
0.72757375	0.6467688	My first one went on pretty good, had to peal and repeal it about 5 times to get it lined up just right.  I did put it on and then put on an Otter Box over.  My husbands did not go on so well and we had to use the 3 sheet and throw away the 2nd due to moving it too many times.  So no spare to fall back on.  Other wise a good product.
0.8607143	0.7426738	Great screen protector, easy to apply (without having to do it in the bathroom with the shower on).  The only thing is that the cutouts for the speaker and camera are off centered.  It's like that for all 3 protectors.  Wonder if it's intentional.  If so, why...?Update: just found out that the big cut outs for the camera and speaker are intentional, because of the sensors next to them.  I have a black phone so it's hard to see the sensors.
0.95253515	0.7977253000000001	Bought a three pack of these, misapplied all three- contacted customer service and they had a replacement out the next day free of charge. Can't beat the customer service.The screen protector itself looks great on my wife's iPhone 5. She's a pretty heavy user but my toddler has begun showing an interest in phones and my daughters fingers aren't always the cleanest- yet the screen protector shows no signs of fingerprints. Definitely worth the money.
0.8451568000000002	0.756555	I don't ofter right reviews, but after having a bad experience with a competitors product. I thought I would warn others.I'm impressed with how easy the Tech Armor screen protectors have been to use.I've recently used them on both an iPad Mini and iPod Touch.The iPod Touch ones went on super easy, and ended up bubble free.Even after having to readjust the protector.(somehow I had it going slightly crooked)
0.88042784	0.8119791000000001	just got it today (3/7/13) and it was easy to install with no bubbles left afterwards . definitely recommend it to others.update (3/8/13) the screen protector shows a lot of fingerprints and smudges but it does not take away from the phone's retina display. It does what it's intended to do which is to protect the screen so it still does its job. I would still recommend it to others.
0.96223295	0.70733273	packaging is very good and items inside is protector and cloth to clean you screen and a tape for you to re do ,very good quality,place perfect at 1st pack at 3rd attempt,that's very nice.and inside the package said if not satisfied you can get a new one for free,i don't know if it's true because i'm hanppy about it,but it's better than other seller that don't give you this promise.in one word,very good company tech armor and very good product
0.9949690000000001	0.80401695	This is a great product. Arrived on time, looks and feels nice on the phone. It does not interfere with the phone's functioning at all. I love it!
0.99543786	0.81782055	Works perfect. Simple as that. Easy to put on and easy to get rid of air bubbles. Have had on for a couple weeks and still in perfect condition.
0.26668742	0.47571343	I cannot believe the ease of application of this screen protector! This is the second screen protector I bought for my husband's iPhone5. The first attempt was Spigen and I spent $14 for 2 protectors. I spent an hour applying that thing and the whole screen was full of bubbles. I was very unsatisfied that I immediately wrote a review on Amazon and then sent Spigen an email saying how unsatisfied I was and I felt ripped off. I removed the Spigen protector (it was really awful) and I was again on the hunt for a good protector. I saw Tech Armor and for the cheap price, I thought I've got nothing to lose. I watched the video and the instruction was simple. The screen  protector came today and installation was under a minute. Almost bubble free, bubbles were mostly on the side and were easy to remove. You can barely see the screen protector and it kept the integrity of the retina display. I am very happy with this purchase.
0.9700588	0.8113451999999999	Installed easy.  Cut outs were perfect.  Optically clear.  Great value (or insurance :) ) with 3 in the pack.I noticed some other reviews mentioned under the home button not being protected, however my screens were cut so they cover the area under the home button. It's possible they have been revised.  Very happy with the cut myself.In case this helps anyone, I found the install very quick and easy if I removed the protective film 1 completely, lined up the bottom of the screen protector near the home button, let it stick there and then with the other hand held the edges of the screen protector and the edges of the phone to make sure alignment is straight at the top and then just slowly roll it on from home button to top.
0.44211218	0.5530548000000001	This screen protector is a very clear protector. It's almost as if there were nothing protecting the screen by how clear it looks. The 3-pack is worth the money.
0.120775014	0.58323956	Bought this for my wife and I to use on our new iphones. ended up using all 3 in the package without any success. I decided to purchase another package, had to use all 3 but finally got them on the 2 phones. unfortunately the next day, one of them started bubbling and peeling off on the side. Other than that problem, shipping was fast. but I'm not too happy with the product.
0.9945867	0.81917953	I saw several screen protectors, but recently purchased an iphone 5 so I wanted a good cover. I received this very fast and the cover went on the first time with no bubbles and no problems. I do not have any touch screen problems with it on and it works great. its a great screen protector
0.99782836	0.75834787	Very easy to apply, no bubbles too! My best experience applying screen protector so far. Will recommend this to friends!
0.44926023	0.5670901999999999	Its pretty good for the price and doesnt looks cheap. 3 packs total and the packaging looks kinda fancy too.
0.9492527	0.75987744	Overall, I am happy with this screen protector. I purchased it for my new iPhone 5. There are a couple bubbles under the screen protector that I can't get off. It is a little bit narrow for my phone too, but I am still happy with this product. It costs less than the other matte screen protectors, and I don't see much of a difference.  I still had a couple bubbles under the more expensive ones I purchased too.
0.21861115	0.42308733	"For the first one, I tried to put it on myself but bubbles were everywhere. I thought it was probably because I sucked, so I brought the second one to the Apple Store. I asked for the best employee at this kind of thing. I watched him try for like 30 minutes and just gave up because it was ""junk quality."" I bought one from the Apple Store ($15) and he just dropped it on and no bubbles. For a few dollars more than this piece of crap, you won't be sitting there trying to squeeze countless bubbles out. And I also recommend buying your screen protector at the Apple Store and having them install it (it's free!)."
0.9974868	0.7642393	Good quality and easy to use.The price is much lower than I purchase from the other store. Highly recommend.
0.9815947	0.7044366999999999	Ordered this for my new iPhone and I received them about three days later. Very easy to instal and and well designed.
0.54173565	0.6573641	I was able to get this cover to lay completely flat on my iphone5 without any bubbles! When it first went down there was still some dust on it so I was able to peel it back, use the tape they provided and remove the dust and put it back, use the squeegee tool (ended up using my license as it was stiffer) to remove all bubbles and now I can't even tell there is a cover on my phone! Very happy
0.9683204	0.66661566	Great price and great product.  Comes 3 to a package, so if you are like me and have a hard time installing, you don't have to worry about ruining the one and only when installing.  But it is easy to install--no bubbles !
0.052200437	0.39633870000000004	Hard to get it on without bubbles. Even after following directions still get bubbles from pieces of dirt/ lint under protector
0.67363703	0.6241693	I liked it. its a neat fit and does not impact the screen resolution. The only issue that I found it a little hard fix it on the screen.
0.20261422	0.56607705	"While this product protects the iPhone screen, it does get subtle scratches and a ""fogginess"" to it that reduces the clarity of the screen. I am not a heavy phone user, taking care to properly place when not in use. Ok product, would look further if I buy again."
0.19671836	0.41557150000000004	I actually put it on wrong at first which usually means the screen protector is ruined.  However I was able to fix my mistake by re-aligning the protector and it came out just fine.
0.9850146999999999	0.76590884	I had trouble putting them on my phone and ruined a couple of them! I emailed tech armor and they resolved my problem and sent me more instruction on application! Awesome company and very durable screen protectors!
0.06740739999999999	0.43319288	I ordered this a while back, I finally got around to using it. The product is not glare or fingerprint proof as advertised. It is just a dark screen protector that feels odd.
0.9945626000000001	0.67673194	It's a very good product it's all it's great for privacy and everything you need for a great phone thank you
0.97666174	0.70652056	I always bought the cheap cut to fit and fought with applying the film.This is SO much easier and seems to be of better quality.Thanks!
0.98043096	0.65683895	Works as it should, easy to install. Comes ready to use in its original packaging and with the proper cleaning tools. Removes all glare and fingerprints.
0.93588156	0.6337772	Provides excellent protection for the screen. The only complaint I have is that it is hard to clean when dirty.
0.61637723	0.38694614	It generally good. Anti-glare and anti-fingerprint as it said. I feel like it's a little smaller than it should be but don't know what other people think.
0.9678344999999999	0.804528	Even though I did not watch in youtube how to install the Tech Armor Anti-Glare and Anti-FIngerprint Scree Protector, I was able to install it with just a few bubbles (about 3 small ones toward the bottom of the screen or home button).  It's so touch sensitive and I don't have difficulty using the phone.  I'm glad that they come in three pieces for future replacements should one of those get so scratched up.  Thank you very much for the speedy delivery!
0.9857152	0.73407626	the quality is really good. Haven't had too much glare or fingerprints. and for the price, it's an amazing deal.
0.19709921	0.46275762	I get it, it's cheap, it comes with a lot of stuff (cloth, card to get the bubbles out, etc.) but it scratches really easily. I bought the brand that you get at the actual apple store for a bit more money and that one didn't get so many scratches. It will protect your glass from scratching but why would you buy a protector that is just going to look like crap until you replace it? the card that gets the bubbles out scratched the sticker while I was applying it if that gives you an idea of it's weakness.
0.001530081	0.4855777	The product I got was missing a part. I was so excited to put it on my new phone, but after I opened it, I was very disappointed.DON'T BUY IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY
0.99711776	0.8507111999999999	A bit tougher than I expected to get on the screen and align properly. It helps to apply this in a humid room. The screen protector quality is great and the speed of the shipping was incredible. I am happy overall with the experience and would recommend purchasing from Tech Armor.
0.9910228000000001	0.74355334	This is a good quality screen protector.  I am very happy with it, and as long as you clean the screen well before, it should apply nicely like it did for me.
0.9985828000000001	0.8144667	this is a great product .easy to install. the anti-fingerprint feature keeps your phone looking a lot cleaner.,best i've used so far.
0.9771873	0.65557253	Great screen protector, clean and Clear, would definitely recommend this item although some say the glass is so tough it may not need a protector, good buy.
0.9936706	0.78987604	Very easy to apply and works well.I would recommend for anybody looking for a privacy screen for the iPhone.
0.9806155000000001	0.7834166	I purchased it on a Tuesday, and got it the following Wednesday. Not exactly the fastest delivery I've had, but that's where the criticism stops. After having the screen protector for about a month, I couldn't be more pleased with it, and it does its job very very well. It's a also a great value and I couldn't help but purchase it for my iPad 3 as well.
0.99682146	0.83129275	Installed one of the 3 screen protectors yesterday on my iPhone 5. Done in less than 5 minutes. So far works great, no fingerprints, definitely cuts the glare. Highly recommended.
0.01838237	0.34928364	I found the screen covers very difficult to apply! It was a waste of money I went through all 3 without a successful application.
0.82810086	0.6771857	I bought these to go with the Luvvitt Christal Hard Shell case and they look good together. I love that I don't see fingerprints on this material. I did get a couple of air bubbles when I applied it but I am only on my first one so maybe I can get better at it with practice. If it would have gone on completely without bubbles it would have been 5 stars. Otherwise, excellent product I am not constantly cleaning my screen.
0.6435350000000001	0.5914055	Love this protectors!! They are so easy to install and the HD is awesome. I told my friends about them they order some and they love them as well. However I bought some for iPhone 4S and I wasn't to impress, bubbles were hard to removed didn't have any luck getting rid of them. I don't understand why, maybe it was just a bad batch. Disappointed on the 4s protector, but amazing experience with the iPhone 5.
0.5650569999999999	0.6226709	Went on very easily, no bubbles on the first try! It's actually hard to tell there's a protector on the screen.
0.9332645	0.7507866999999999	Good value, works well for what I need.  I've tried the 'lifetime guarantee' ones that cost 10x as much and they still only lasted less than a year then you pay shipping to get a replacement.  This works the same and is a way better deal.
0.995574	0.83129716	I have extremely sensitive eyes.  I needed an antiglare screen protector for outdoor use.  Tech Armor is the best!  Great price, easy to install and works as advertised.  I have not noticed any diminished screen clarity with the iPhone's retinal display.  I'm now able to use my iPhone outdoors with my sunglasses on.
0.0471431	0.40992114	I originally purchased HD screens from tech armor and was able to apply successfully after two attempts. But within couple days, i noticed a small tear/hole on the protector (thought it was a bubble at first). So I took out my third screen to apply and for some reason it was a lint magnet. Being very disappointed at their quality, I decided to give them another shot and ordered ballistic glass protector instead. It's awesome! so much easier to apply. I wish I ordered this one sooner and not waste $ on their HD screens.After few days of use, i noticed scratches that wont' go away to the ballistic protector already :( very disappointing quality...
0.99902	0.71492565	Great quality!. Easy to put on. Good instructions. I will definitely purchase from your company again. Definitely recommend it!! Thank you.
0.99630487	0.8449701	These screen protectors are amazing. It doesn't even feel like anything is on my phone. The price and customer service can't be beat. It comes with three screen protectors. I'm on to my second one. That's my fault though because the installation is actually quite simple. I followed the written and video instructions. I'm pleased with the fact that there are little to no air bubbles when you install these. Will repurchase as needed.
0.98939013	0.8472270000000001	Ok I will be honest, this is not the first screen protector Ive purchased and I'll have to admit I'm a bit of a snob about them now!  So with that said let me tell you that these are some of the BEST I have gotten!!! Fit is great but the clarity is AMAZING!!! Clear, and still looking great months later.  This is the one you want....and my best advice is DON'T USE the cloth to clean....Use an Eyeglass cleaner (like a moist towelette type of thing).  The kind we use is great...I use only one if phone is new or 2-3 if phone has been used before.  On final cleaning wipe only one direction and use light to check for any lint or dirt on phone....once phone screen is clear and clean as possible get a credit card ready (make sure all screen punch outs are removed first) then peel back only top section set top 1/4 down using credit card to apply and remove air bubbles (careful not to touch clean phone while you peel back cover....remember you can pick back up the attached screen if the bubbles are too many or to hard to remove.  Then as you use the credit card to slowly apply screen protector (as you peel with other hand.....now the very end use finger nail to keep one corner of screen lifted until every bubble is removed and then only set down when you have no need to pick up again.  Lets just say this techniques works great and all my phone screen protectors are PERFECT!!!!!
0.9817530000000001	0.81334484	If you are a fumble fingers like me, this is the one for you!  After reading reviews of this and other brands, I decided on this one because it seemed like less fuss to get it on and also is completely clear.  It was a piece of cake to put on.  I used my eyeglass cleaner to clean the screen and followed with an air blower that you use to clean keyboards, easy tabs to pull back once you get a small section down and done!  Can't even tell its there.  I didn't want a brand that I needed a liquid to seal it on - I need uncomplicated. If you do too, this is the one for you.  And like I said, can't even see it. It is perfectly clear.  I also like that 3 come in the pack.
0.9980943999999999	0.8492048000000001	The screen is super clear, can't even tell there is one applied sometimes.  The screen feels like it is glass.  My first batch of screen protectors were less than perfect, Tech Armor responded and sent me replacements to ensure that I am a happy customer.  Highly recommended.
0.5207149	0.72585434	Excellent product and they give you everything you need except...The directions are in very small print and this makes installation more difficult. After you clean it with the cloth, be sure to keep the #1 tab facing down when you put it on and fit it. When this tab is pulled back it exposes the tacky part of the protector.  Be careful to start the fitting at the bottom of the ipod first with the #1 tab pulled back an inch or so to start.  Then pull #1 tab off while making sure to keep everything lined up.  You can either leave on or remove the #2 tab to push the air bubbles out.You can use your finger nail to pull up on the protector if you missed something and use the screen tape to remove.  My install had issues, but it ended up looking good later.
0.58248717	0.6612302	Sadly the side has come up and wont stick back down, but otherwise a good buy - the touch screen works perfectly with the Tech Armor on and looks after the phone well.
0.9187166999999999	0.74348474	The anti finger prints is perfect for my OCD of a clean screen! Now I don't have to wipe my phone down after every use.
0.6731639	0.604122	"I attempted to install 2 of the three protectors, but found it virtually impossible to prevent dust and air bubbles.  I had just installed a screen protector from another company about a month ago and it was MUCH easier to install.  That product was more expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I have one more left, but I have no idea how to get it installed without air bubbles and dust.UPDATE 8/15/13:  After reading my above review Tech Armor Customer Service responded with regret to my failed attempts.  In order to make things ""right"" they sent another pack of screen protectors and gave me a couple suggestions to make installation easier.  Well, I am happy to report that following their suggestion of doing the install in the bathroom to cut down on dust worked like a charm!  I was able to place the protector on with one try!  It looks so good you can hardly tell it's there!  Great product and even better customer service!!!"
0.93710434	0.75128704	Excellent protectors...three in a pack.  Easy to put on.  I put the first one on perfectly but had cut the protector b/c someone suggested i trim it so my case doesn't push it up and make bubble.  I dont suggest this.  Took it off and put the next one one.  Looks great (in that you cant see it), and doesnt bubble up with my case on it.
0.99377334	0.83568704	Very easy to apply as protector literally meld to glass screen with little chance of bubbles; should make iPhone screen free of lint and smudge for best results obviously, but any bubbles not from lint or dust are easily squeezed off.  Protector goes on crystal clear and doesn't have that sticky plasticky feel of some plastic screen protector. Also sized perfectly so that my Speck iphone case doesn't bite into the protector lifting it up or prevent adhesion.  Getting three protectors in one package is also a great deal.  Got mind shipped fast also.  Very, very satisfied!
0.99036324	0.7945656999999999	has a nice matte finish protects my iphone 5 screen very well & it's lasting much longer than what you would get at the store. will be purchasing more again.
0.007818997	0.47609204	I tried to install these per the instuctions and ended up using up all three protectors due to unsatifactory results.  Very frustrating and a waste of $7.  If you plan to buy these, you may need to purchase two packages.  I would never purchase again.
0.8873949000000001	0.6559094	I purchased the Tech Armor for my iPhone 5 recently and found it to be of high quality at a low price. I also purchase the Kindle Fire screen protectors. I really like the lifetime return/exchange guarantee too. Will definitely order more for my other electronics
0.83630866	0.67641896	Got this product through amazon. The screen protector went on very smoothly with zero bubbles. Installation was a breeze and it is not even noticeable on screen
0.979836	0.80140775	This is a good, quality product.  It has substance (not flimsy) and is easy to apply to the iPhone.  Highly recommend.
0.92573965	0.75627565	One of the less expensive products on the market, and best screen-saver I ever bought. Unlike every other one I tried, this one went on very smoothly, with no airbubbles--a first for me. Also, while other screensavers I'd bought before didn't indicate which was the sticky side and which wasn't, this one was clearly marked. Great product!
0.32294983	0.6062168000000001	Works to keep the screen protected, but hard to get the bubbles out. Doesn't look attractive with the bubbles in the middle of the screen.
0.14451817	0.39624774	This was very thick, so I guess it is good protection, but the phone was difficult to use so I removed it.
0.99451315	0.7761405	I bought this for my daughter so people couldn't read over her shoulder or when sitting next her while she was on her phone. I think she actually wanted it so I wouldn't be the one looking over her shoulder reading what she was texting. LOL She absolutely loves it and wants me to stock up on them. She's afraid the current one will get ruined and she says she can't live without this on her phone. I'll definitely be purchasing more if needed. They work great!
0.108104795	0.32330155	I searched for back cover protector and this one came up so I bought it....it doesnt come with a back cover...
0.99084425	0.83159095	Great product ... Works as advertised. Went on very easily, much better than any other screen protector that I've tried. Would definitely recommend this product. Manufacturer seems to be very customer centric.
0.68437266	0.6316005	I dropped my iPhone 5 and put a huge crack in the screen.  To make sure I didn't get any glass splinters, I picked up these screen protectors.  The quality is very good and the install was easy-breezy.  A few minutes of use and you forget it's even there.  It sticks fine, even to the shattered corner of my phone.
0.5098073000000001	0.62327886	"I owned an IPhone4 for four years (leave it to the English language to have three ways to use that word). During that time I had only used the Tech Armor screen protectors and I was very happy with them. When my wife and I finally decided to upgrade our phones to the IPhone5 I decided to pay $10 (down from $25) for the Zagg ""high quality lifetime replacement"" screen protector. What a joke/waste of money/piece of crap that was. It had a really bubble look to it that distorted the screen and was deemed ""normal"" by the Best Buy team that installed it.Needless to say I did not even attempt to return the Zagg screen protector. I just bought this three pack for myself and my wife for half of the price and got two of them. After installing the Tech Armor screen protector I was very happy to see that it was just like I remembered (virtually non existent). The screen protector is extremely difficult to even tell it is on and if you are careful about making sure everything is clean the application will not have any bubbles.This is definitely a product I will continue to purchase for all of screens that need protecting."
0.8581698	0.7345821	I shopped around for a cover for my IPhone 5 screen and this was the best value.Directions could have been better i was confused at one point but it really was easy to place on.I was able to do it on the first try.Getting the bubbles out from underneath the screen was not too hard either just need some patience but they will be gone.If they had a matted finish one that would be super this way you don't see the fingerprints on the screen
0.43892688	0.6307986	"Fast shipping! Does the whole ""privacy"" thing however you have to put your brightness down a ton and can't see with it in the sunlight"
0.99571013	0.8970017	This is probably the best screen protector I have ever purchased, which is ridiculous to say, but still true.This went on with no problems, and for the first time ever, I didn't have a single bit of dust or air bubble underneath the screen.Tech Armor sends with the product a strip of 'anti-dust' tape (I think just a basic adhesive) that lets you pull off all fingerprints, dust, particles, etc. before you actually apply the screen protector, in addition to the micro-fiber cloth to wipe it down.One tip: apply the screen protector in the bathroom with the shower running hot. The steam prevents particles from floating around, and makes the air thicker so that you don't get dust and whatever else on the phone right before you put the screen protector on.All in all, this product is easy to apply, works great, really does help in the sunshine, and I haven't seen a single fingerprint on my phone after applying this (even after eating greasy food).I highly recommend this freaking awesome product! And yes, I know how ridiculous this sounds to be so excited about a screen protector, but I've been so frustrated in the past with others, and this just works.Zero frustration here. Just a happy customer.
0.9763200000000001	0.7161423000000001	I always have struggled putting screen protectors on my iPhone. The instructions make it sound easy, but it never worked out quite right. With the Tech Armor protector I followed the instructions exactly and the film went on perfect without any bubbles. And now that its on, I can barely tell there is a film on the screen. Its only been a week with it on, so I don't know how long it will last. But so far I am happy.
0.83460385	0.70341206	I've had bad (and admittedly limited) experiences with screen protectors in the past, mostly due to dust and bad looks and the all-annoying bubbles. This is the best screen protector I've ever used. Applying screen protector was surprisingly painless, and THERE ARE NO ANNOYING BUBBLES. It's also invisible! I can't tell that I have a screen protector on. The best part? There are 2 more in case dust gets in or it gets scratched up down the road. Wonderful product!
0.7820493000000001	0.64665085	I bought the Tech Armor protector with my Iphone 5.  Thought it would be piece of cake to install.  Alas, even installing it under range hood, got bubbles every time (3x).  Notified Tech Armor, said they would replace-I thought that was great.  Never received it.  Called again-we'll replace-problems with new system- never received.  I would not recommend this unless you have a pro install it.  Also their customer service has a lot of room for improvement.
0.98508084	0.79415	This is a great screen protector!  I've had others before that didn't line up exactly right, not clear enough, difficult to get dust off of, etc.  But this is a great price for a 3-pack and I probably will never use the other 2.  Everything you need is included in the package.  Read the instructions, or watch their video instructions, and everything works perfectly!  I'll never buy another!
0.9559361999999999	0.7603903000000001	The Tech Armor screen protector is a quality product and fills the claims of the manufacturer. The installation is easy... dispite the lack of good instructions. I recommend the product.
0.9646742	0.77373743	I put this on my phone and it was as advertised. Easy to install and did what it said. Installed correct the first time.
0.98648614	0.83157706	you definitely need protection for your smartphone screen.  I read up on Tech Armor and it had good ratings in Amazon for a good price.  It was easy to install; they provided a link to a video showing how to apply it before it has arrived.  They also supplied a few items, such as a card to remove air bubbles and a cloth to keep it clean.  I would recommend it.
0.99126685	0.7309059	I Got This For My Girlfriend And i was Really Easy To Install and Not To Mention Fast!! Great Service
0.99143577	0.78192896	This was the absolutely best screen protector I have bought for my Iphone 5, very clear, and really displays the HD apple screen efficiently. Installation was a breeze, and I did not have any air bubbles when installed... Will buy more! Shipping was fast too!
0.08814803	0.6373696999999999	I don't leave many reviews on Amazon.com, eventhough I do make a fair few purchases, almost all of which are positive experiences. In this case, however, I feel compelled to leave a review to save someone out there 15 minutes of frustration and a few cups of coffees. This item essentially consists of 3 nicely wrapped pieces of junk. The problems with this item are as follows. First, it consists of the &#34;clear screen protector&#34; which is affixed lightly to a backing that easily peels off. The backing easily peels off because there is what I will call a &#34;peeling assist sticker&#34; stuck to the surface of the screen protector (yes, you guessed it, to the surface that you'll be using after you affix the screen protector to your iPhone). This &#34;peeling assist sticker&#34; protrudes from the bottom of the clear screen, making it very easy to grab hold of, and slowly peel the clear screen protector up and away from the plastic backing. After cleaning your iPhone with the included cleaning cloth and dust-removal sticker (yup, yet another sticky thing to play around with), one then gradually peels off the clear screen protector from the backing and carefully affixes it to the iphone screen. The idea is that after you carefully affix that clear screen protector to your iPhone, you then remove that small &#34;peeling assist sticker&#34; from the top surface of the clear screen protector. But here's the problem. It is impossible to remove the peeling assist-sticker without either damaging the surface of the screen protector, and leaving behind a thick, gunky gluey residue on the bottom right hand side of the clear screen protector, rending it pretty much useless. Now, maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad batch. However, I must be twice as unlucky because I also bought the iPhone 4s version of this same product a week earlier and experienced exactly the same problem. As a scientist (a chemist to be exact), I could advise you to apply heat to the sticker to assist with it's removal from the surface of the clear screen protector, however given the shear viscosity of the residual, gluey residue on the clear screen protector, I can't imagine that anything less than a hot hair dryer would allow you to remove the peeling assist sticker away from the clear screen protector without causing irrepairable damage to the screen protector and/or your phone. I have not tried this experiement, not do I have the inclination, will, or time to bother. I would much prefer investing that time on writing this review, which I hoped you enjoyed reading, and maybe even found somewhat amusing. I can tell ya, I'm not laughing! Amazon - (I want my coffee money back) x 2!!
0.9799906999999999	0.8196131	If you take your time, follow the direction and really carefully look for dust, this screen protector will look great.  The tape works great for getting those last pesky dust particles.  The screen protector has a top layer that is removed at the end of the process, so you can really get aggressive about working any small air bubble out.  After you have used the enclosed squeegee, you remove the top layer and have a crystal clear screen protector.  Has a very nice smooth touch.
0.988023	0.79709095	I ordered this product on Amazon and it came immediately. I'm in Florida and the screen is easy to see in bright light; it is so much better than regular film. I carefully place my i5 in a pocket of my purse, but... other things migrate or bulge in to it, nice to know it has a strong extra coat on it. It was also incredibly easy to put on with no air bubbles. None of the Verizon stores carried it, which is very strange. Great product!!Tech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty for Apple iPhone 5 [3-Pack]
0.9108958	0.77900326	I just received these screen protectors in the mail yesterday and installed it tonight.  Install was quite easy especially with the provided micro-fiber cloth and card to smooth out the bubbles.  It does appear to retain some fiber-prints but not nearly as much as other screen protectors I have used in the past.  Anti-glare works quite well as the slight cost of marginally dimming the screen.
0.9982066999999999	0.85350585	Great screen protecters. No bubbles at all. I would definitely recommend this to any iPhone 6 owner! Tech Armor is the best at any iPhone 6 accessories!
0.99036807	0.7936937	Easy to apply and very clear, most people can't even tell there is a screen protector applied. Be sure to use a canned duster to get all micro dust off before applying. Easy instructions to follow.
0.9915976999999999	0.76002693	Great product for a Great price. Actually, small price to pay to protect something so expensive.I would buy again
0.08744255	0.62778807	A little disappointed. After a few months, some edges are flipping up.
0.9975444	0.81857145	I found this screen proctor easy to install (good instructions) & is so well designed one would never know it is on top of the screen glass. Touch screen works as if there was no cover. Fit is perfect. Highly recommended!
0.8053664	0.77914166	When I bought my iPhone from T Mobile, I bought a screen protector from the stand at T Mobile at the same time. The protector was thick, unwieldy, cloudy,  and,  when finally set, full of air pockets. I spotted these on Amazon at a substantially reduced price. They arrived quickly, and when I lay them on the screen, they lay flat, air pockets were minimal and they are thinner. I can not attest to durability.  There are three so I have back ups.
0.9789046	0.81878865	I really like this product.  The protectors are very transparent, and hard to damage.  I have in the past tried similar products that were prone to bubbles, and this one is the best I have tried.  I was able to get a perfect seal on the screen, with no bubbles.
0.9974184000000001	0.762534	Quality product. I received it timely and had everything I needed. Good price and perfect fit. Definitely recommend for your iPhone 5s.
0.038047522	0.41918212	I found it impossible to remove bubbles from underneath screen protector even with additional support videos.  Had much better luck in the past with other products.  Maybe if I had the time and patience it would have worked out, unfortunately I don't feel the need to get a Phd in screen protector implementation to be able to use the product.
0.8418009	0.6434687	Haven't had a scratch since I put on one of Tech Armor's protective screen covers.  I think by accident I may have put two screen protectors on my phone, but I finally figured that out after about a week.  I peeled off the 2nd layer and I was good to go.  It worked well with my protective case that I also bought on Amazon (Incase CL69035 Slider Case for iPhone 5 - Black)
0.31854165	0.42880192	Since I just broke my screen on my new iphone 5 I should have purchased this in the beginning.  It fits good and I'm hoping I don't have to put it to the test.
0.083910316	0.46263996	I have used many different brands of screen protectors on all generations of iPhones. While the kit looked great and was amazing looking, the durability of the product is beyond horrible. Within 2 days I had scratches on the screen simply from where I swipe my thumb to unlock my iPhone. I don't have the softest skin (after all I am a guy) but I surely don't have sandpaper hands. After a few more days passed the screen protector acquired several more scratches from simply being in my pocket. To put into perspective I had the previous screen protector on my iPhone 5 for over 12 months and it still looked better than the TechArmor screen protector did after only 5 days. The product is plain and simple junk and I wish there was a way I could be reimbursed for the 7 bucks I spent on Amazon. I'd give this product zero stars if it were an option.
0.010166436	0.23071551	I thought I ordered the screen protector for iPhone 4s but obviously didn't.  Tried to return for exchange and the process is such a hassle I'm going to try to sell them to someone that owns an iPhone 5.  My mistake but return/exchange process way too much trouble.
0.35871315	0.6883758000000001	"I just installed three screens, (one twice because of lint).  Pretty easy to do and looks fine.  A little hard to get square but not that bad.  Biggest problem was the glue on the paper tab to place the screen on the iphone.  You need to remove that when you finish the installation, tab labeled ""remove me"".  The glue is such that the tab won't peel off.  After you wrestle it free from the cover, some of the glue with the shredded paper is still on the screen protector.  I spent several minutes on each install carefully rubbing and picking to get the tab remnants off.  Looks ok finally, but a bit of a pain.  Would have given it 5 stars but for that.  Surely there has to be a better glue that allows easier removal of the tab."
0.56654465	0.57887334	Bought this for my wife. She was able to apply the protector herself. It seems like a decent item. The only thing I have heard her say about it was negative. I guess she positioned it a half a millimeter too high.My preference is usually more for a matte finish as I find them much better in regards to glare (the matte finish protectors have their own issues too).The seller asked me to post feedback on the item so that is why I offer my bland opinion. If I had fiddled with it more first hand, my opinion might be more of a 4 star. As it is, all I've heard was what my wife has said. That along with my assumption that there will be a glare and I am going with 3 stars.
0.99424195	0.7099911	as many have mentioned, customer service is top-notch.  product is great and price is right.  i would strongly recommend tech.
0.92244697	0.5826048	I love the look and feel of this. Haven't put it through too much so don't know if it gets scratches easy but the way it feels I don't think it will. I would recommend this to everyone! Just great!
0.8017085	0.653764	Need to be careful on the alignment before you stick it down & also make sure the screen is REALLY clean - any speck will cause a bubble.
0.89587057	0.8367576999999999	This screen protector is on the same level, if not even better, than many of more expensive protectors.  The fact that you receiver three protects is great, so you can protect multiple devices or have a spare in case you mess up with installation.Once put on the phone, the screen is barely noticeable and feels no different from the regular screen.  It can be slightly difficult to line up and put on your phone correctly, and if you're anything like me and what you have your phone look as perfect as possible, you'll quickly find it to be slightly annoying.I put one on for a friend of mine, I was done in 5 minutes and had no issues.  However, when putting a cover on my phone it was a slightly different story. Messed up the first attempt by accidentally getting finger smears on the adhesive side(my fault here, dropped the cover when peeling the protective plastic off).  On the second try, I managed to get the cover on but it wasn't lined up quite right, but after playing with it for a few minutes the cover was lined up as best as I could get it to be.  The only downside is that there are about 2 or 3 dust specs stuck under the cover now, and since I don't have anymore it seems I'll have to live with them.Only thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars is that the cover can be slightly difficult to apply to the phone and line up correctly.
0.9996786	0.8959459000000001	Best screen protectors I've ever used!! Fit new iPhone 5S perfectly. I did one on my phone and one on my wife's. You can't see either one. The HD Clear protectors look just like the phone screen. No distorting the beautiful Retina display! Awesome! I highly recommend these screen protectors!
0.99646664	0.86332226	There's a lot of options out there for screen protectors, but the Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector for iPhone is by far one of the best.  It was very easy to install and provides a clear image of the screen.  Cutouts are located at the top for the camera, speaker and light sensor and at the bottom for the home button.  This product came with 3 screen protectors which allows for plenty of cushion throughout your iPhones life.
0.9977488999999999	0.6983549	Awesome. this was a fantastic product and exactly what i wanted. i will more than likely buy more in the future.
0.9206127000000001	0.8393815	This provides good protection for iphone 5 screen.  No fingerprints, pretty easy to apply, cuts down on glare.  It does change the look and the feel of the screen somewhat.  The screen doesn't look as glossy, kind of a frosty look but still very clear and responds well to touch.  Very good price and I think if you are rough on your screen, it's definitely a good choice.
0.021937251	0.30815798	I bought for a nexus because it cued up a screen protector for this device.  I tried to trim to size and it was a mess that never stuck
0.9848269000000001	0.7806251000000001	Product is of good quality and it was easy to install. Had adequate instructions and also give a link to watch a video for installation.
0.99709594	0.8461546	This went on clean with no bubbles or tears. Exactly what I expected and wanted at a very affordable price.No complaints here.
0.124758124	0.36015147	did not read the instruction so lost the first screen to dust particles between the screen and glass of the iphone.  suggest using a very low dust area to install the screen.  read the instruction first.
0.12718037	0.47595155	I had a very difficult time putting this screen protector on. Maybe it's just me. First two times came out horrible, third time came out better than the first two but it still has many noticeable bubbles underneath.
0.77181643	0.63118005	Just as good as the $20 versions.  Read the directions because bubbles are always a problem with this kind of product.
0.99470794	0.8142522	Got these for my new iPhone.  It was pretty easy to apply with the included squeegee thing, and works just like nothing's over the screen at all.  I'd recommend this for anyone who wants to save their screen.
0.99468315	0.8065276	The best thing you can say about these screen protectors is that they don't take up all of your attention.  These protect the screen without being noticeable.I applied one of them to the brand new iPhone 5 screen and it went on easy.
0.92461383	0.6470725	Very easy to install . I followed the instructions exactly and the application was perfect on the first attempt. I did not use the dust collector tape, but didn't seem to need it. Thanks for this very good product. Now what do I do with the other 2 protectors that came in the package? :-)
0.99740446	0.85103416	Pros:Excellent film quality, touch sensitive and almost invisible after installation.Very easy to install, comes with all the stuff needed to do an easy installation if you follow the instructions.Very good price.Cons:You have to pay shipping (5 bucks)for the protector's envelope, still you save a few bucks compared to a cellphone store.
0.15000841	0.4504719	went on smoothly - annoying dust particle created circle under protector - use of tape won't remove it - I will live with it as all else on the install is good.
0.9304650999999999	0.7399486999999999	Application was easy and trouble-free.  The item comes with 3 protectors, after about a month, I'm still on the first one.  Adhesion to the iPhone is good, no air bubbles, and it's easy to clean.
0.3528047	0.57255554	Good instructions. I'd add to them to be careful not to bend the plastic when peeling it off to reposition the protector. I did and realized that it kept popping back up at the top of the phone!  Grrrr really mad at myself then I realized that they had counted on someone like me and had included 2 more chances. Forewarned the 2nd time I got it right. Very clear - can not tell it is on the phone!  Recommend it highly.
0.9874288	0.81231016	Perfect fit and installed with no air bubbles. I would recommend using canned air or an air compressor to blow the screen right before installing the protector to ensure no dust gets under the protector. Also use scotch tape on one side to keep the protector aligned perfectly.
0.8932899	0.49734855	I would call this a good buy. Not only do they work great, but I have extras. Go for it, your phone will thank you.
0.9394075999999999	0.77396655	The screen protector went on exactly as shown in the video.  I've had it on for 2 weeks without any problems at all.  No bubbles or creases.
0.9924968000000001	0.68425107	I recommend this product to ALL iphone 5 users! My girlfriend was satisfied with the product. The price is good and it got delivered on time!
0.60854	0.62205565	Just be careful not to let it bubble up when putting it on. Otherwise, it's great. No touch screen interface issues which would be my only apprehension.
0.29301643	0.4130692	"Screen protector application is probably the worst part of owning a smart phone.  I have yet to find a product that leaves me saying, ""That application was an absolutely delightful experience!""  That said, Tech Armor has developed a product that will allow you to protect your phone with minimal hassle AND cost.  I'll definitely come knocking on their door when this tedious task comes my way again."
0.8919282	0.63402736	Saw the reviews and didnt believe it for the low price.. But it was worth a try..After I got the screen protector I was a believer.... def. a great buy...cant go wrong
0.56550306	0.77908015	I loved my iPhone 5, but with this matte screen protector it is practically perfect. It is much smoother to scroll and use, fingerprints hardly show at all, and it is much easier to see in the sun. I understand the appeal of a glossy screen (makes colors really punchy,) but I had the phone for 2 minutes and it looked horrible from all the fingerprints. This makes the phone so much better.
0.9654751	0.8543825	"The screen protector works as advertised.  The cut-outs are perfectly aligned, no fingerprints, no glare, and most importantly, NO bubbles.  It can be a challenge to perfectly align to the holes the first time but it is forgiving if you messed up.  I had to remove the top portion in order to re-align to the camera/speaker holes. The instruction indicated 2 ""remove me"" tabs but it only came with one so I was a bit confused at first.  It'd probably be easier to apply if there are 2 tabs.  Since it is a matt finish, you definitly loss the retina beauty of an iPhone and its brightness.  I had to reset it to brighter.  Overall, works great and only used 1 protector with 2 left."
0.99034876	0.81020546	Comes with three screen protectors which is awesome and the fit well. I don't even notice the screen protector. Also comes with a cloth to wipe down smudges.
0.08338976	0.43184300000000003	Once the protector is on the phone it feels sticky, it's hard to use any swiping or scrolling features, and it collects tons of dust and dirt.
0.99285793	0.8546094000000001	Easy to apply, kit comes with paper squeegee and tape to help remove the stubborn piece of dust that get stuck.  There is no need to start over with a new protector just get the tape and remove it. The company makes these protectors for many devices and I'd expect the same quality of those products as well.  I purchased the HD clear and don't notice the protector at all.  I will purchase the privacy model for my mini and look forward to enjoying that too.  Lastly,  this is a great value can't beat the price.
0.98681116	0.84838414	Fits perfect over the front camera, speaker and home button, greatly reduces glare. Does everything it claims in it's advertising. very satisfied.
0.9530915000000001	0.78292793	This screen protector went on easy the first time, which means that I have two replacements.  The hardest part of using the screen protector is the alignment.  This is a great value
0.9979665999999999	0.8218306999999999	This screen is perfect for protecting your iPhone 5 from bystandards looking at your screen. Yes it is a bit darker but still works very well. Very easy to apply and resulted in no bubbles. Highly recommended for the price!
0.9889071	0.7981414000000001	I gave this product a try and I chose it over the previous one I had on my iPhone 5.  You also have 2 spare protective film if you screw the first one and at $5.95 Prime is a steal.  It does the job and the best thing is that its glossy and not matt and looks like there is nothing in the screen.  If you have a camera/eyeglass lens cleaning cloth, it will wipe out the grease and fingerprints on the film very easily.The Tech Armor case for my iPhone 5 seem to blend in well as the film is perfectly cut to the case as no part of the edge is lifting--that is if you aligned the film really well on application.
0.70754856	0.62680465	this works great and its really easy to put on. if you check the picture it says 3 come in box but that's not the case. only 1 protector come in the box which kinda suck. but product works great.
0.99198925	0.8058753000000001	They're super affordable and easily the best screen protector I've had. It literally feels and looks like there's no screen protector.
0.9928591	0.7812804	I am very, very, very impressed with these SP's. I followed the installation video on their site, and my first attempt was a success! I can barely tell that it is there, and it definitely seems like it will be very durable! Thank you Tech Armor for designing such an outstanding product! I will be a customer for life.
0.8602601000000001	0.63906103	i got the matte finish protectors and it dulls the resolution a lot so i got these to replace the matte screens. they are so much better!
0.9216865	0.73112965	Keeping it short, nice film, covers 99% of the front surface and im talking about the borders. it was really easy to install, did not suffered with the air bubbles like with the other films I previously bought.TOTALLY RECOMMENDED
0.80622935	0.6732022	A bit hard to get rid of bubbles but does a great job.... Almost looks like professionally applied.. good buy
0.91531515	0.8107541	This privacy screen was everything I wanted in a screen protector for an incredibly reasonable price. It comes with a dust cleaner, a card to squeeze out the bubbles, and is really easy to put on. The product does just what it says in the description while not being too dark and private to the point where it's hard to see the screen yourself. Excellent, excellent product. You can probably find the same screen protector for $15-$20 more in a store.
0.8170496	0.61148006	While using my iPhone, I got asked why I playing with the screen if I didn't have the phone on plenty of times. That's how well the screen protector works. If you try to look at what someone is doing from the side you won't be able to. What I really enjoyed was that somehow they made it so if you want to watch a video with someone else you still can. Anyways, if you are looking to get a screen protector this should be one of your top 5.If you are scared that you will have to bring your brightness up because the screen protector is too bright, know that you won't have to. The only times that I've had to bring up the brightness a little is when I'm outside with the sun blaring, otherwise it's fine.
0.9464505	0.7940765000000001	Works exactly as it should. Comes with three screen protectors, a cloth to wipe down the phone and a card to smooth out the bubbles (don't use the card they give you; just use a real credit card and it will work a lot better). Yes, bubbles are inevitable but they are easily smoothed out. I was even able to smooth out a tiny spec of dust caught under the film. It's a really good value.
0.9895165000000001	0.8215343	This is my second purchase of tech armor, this time it was for my i5. The results were good, hd clear as advertised easy to install no issues with bubbles etc.
0.99187773	0.8667113000000001	I have applied many screen protectors to mine and my parents gadgets over the last fe years and have to say these are the best I've found. Very easy to line up and had zero bubbles after application. Plus if you do mess up the first time, there are two back-up ones! These are superior to the previous anti-glare one that I had bought at the Apple store, which scratched way too easily, while these Tech Armor ones resist scratches very well!
0.93819225	0.7912738	I had a dark anti-glare screen with privacy protection. I was wondering why my battery was draining so fast.  Then I realized that the screen was set on the brightest setting.  Duh.  Anyhow I used this matte verison and it does the trick.  The screen went on easily and wasn't too hard to line up.  Screen looks sharp to me. I don't know why some people complained about the clarity.And how do you beat the price on Amazon??!??  Get it!
0.25576420000000005	0.48871154	Purchased a 3 pack and used all three,they don't adhere to the screen very well. They are full of static and attract dust very easily. I'll spend the extra money and a get a Zagg.
0.9855261000000001	0.77666306	These screen protectors fit well and last a long time.  They will protect your screen just as well as any other protector I have used.
0.99376607	0.78237486	Worked great.  No problem applying this screen protector.  Blended in perfectly with the phone and can hardly tell it's there.
0.9959235999999999	0.69185585	It is super clear and suits my iphone 5 very well.Nice product! Nice price! I love the protector very much!
0.97193545	0.8447245000000001	I was doubtful at first because these things tend to be a shot in the dark. Here's what I love:It is glass clear - not matte, no small bubbles (Zagg), not clear with oily color stains, not clear but with cloudy effect - glass clear. The touch is as if glass, so it is literally as if the protector is not there, which is exactly what I wanted. The holes align perfectly with the camera, top speaker, and menu button, and they wrap all the way around, with no parts exposed (some protectors have wide gaping holes - not this one, its pretty spot on, my friends were jealous actually). Another small thing I noticed - normally a film has a set thickness, and at the edges you can see it when it is on your phone, eventually it might turn white because of gunk. But this protector is nice because the sides are shaved down at the edges, so it blends straight into the edge of your phone. Nice touch. Application process is same as all other brands - do it after a shower or under an oven hood.
0.53899705	0.5050435000000001	I like this screen protector alot but installing it was hard. The dust kept going in and couldnt install it until the third protector. My first protector and second  when i peeled the  remove tab it had alot of pieces of dust couldn't get it out but It was my fault that i install it in a dusty area
0.9965006	0.86001366	The product was shipped and received promptly.  I don't remember the brand of the last screen saver I used but it was hard to apply and didn't feel right.  The Tech Armor was surprisingly easy to apply.  The few bubbles easily came out with the included tool.  I've had it on for several days now and the clarity and feel is great.  I would definitely purchase this again.
0.035517097000000004	0.40647649999999996	It started peeling in 24 hours after I put it on correctly. I have used much better screens then this.
0.9721979	0.8064194	Does exactly what it says it will do.Protects the screen without interferring with the touch performance and the visual retna display.
0.9424224	0.81103885	I followed the instructions on Tech Armor's website and still had a lot of difficulty in applying the screen protector to my phone. The first two screen protectors were no good, but I finally got it right on the third try.The protector itself is great--there's some minor color washout but the lack of fingerprints and the ease of use in direct sunlight are definite benefits with very little drawback.
0.95789504	0.8077865	I found this easy to apply, and it went on with fewer bubbles than another protector we tried. No problem using the phone; just apply the protector and forget it.
0.24961758	0.4013839	everithing was ok I am agree whith this product .. . . . .  . . . . . . .
0.97519505	0.70099485	I have bought similar products in the past.But this protector is the best for me, look clear and the HD (well looks nice)I recommend it.
0.58033454	0.47827816	Smudges more then I would like, The fit is fine, but not as good as some more expensive ones I have purchased in the past.
0.48750519999999997	0.6105823	This definitely does what it's supposed to do.  My only complaint is my issue, not the product's.  I wasted two just trying to get them on my phone without an air bubble.
0.9971386999999999	0.8332514000000001	Quality of the screen protectors is excellent. Went on easy, just clean the screen really well and follow the instructions! Can't even tell its on the phone! I will definitely be buying these again. They claim a lifetime warrenty, but I'm not sure exactly what that covers.
0.43781164	0.6712873	It does make the screen a LITTLE darker, but it's not a big deal. Visibility is greatly reduced when the screen is viewed on an angle -- the more angle, the less you can see.
0.99175155	0.7051666	Very easy to install with the little card they provid., I love the cleaning cloth because I can use it to clean my glasses 8-)
0.19431376	0.4030269	Directions were bit confusing (which is lame for a little piece of plastic) and the protector is already bubbled and scratched.
0.9819771	0.7921491999999999	I ordered this product recently.  When I first received these and put one on, I was surprised just how easy the installation was.  In the past I have been horrible at putting on screen protectors and always had a lot of bubbles.  After watching the installation video on tech armors website, it was a breeze and I have ZERO bubbles on my screen.  Looks great.I did notice it lowers the video quality some so I asked tech armor to send the clear HD's for me to try which they gladly sent me free of charge (I'll be receiving soon).While I am waiting for the clear HD ones to arrive, I am actually really starting to like the look and feel of the matte screen protector, haha.  I will try a clear HD upon arrival, but I think I will probably end up putting a matte back on because not only does it help greatly with glare and fingerprint marks (which were really annoying with previous protectors), but again I'm really liking the look of the screen through the protector now and it has a great feel to it.If you're in need of a screen protector and are thinking about ordering some online, you can't go wrong ordering from Tech Armor.  This company has some of the best customer service I've seen and they are committed to make you happy, and it appears they have great products like this one.  Oh yeah, along with a life-time warranty.  I'm happy with the purchase.
0.4004563	0.50234973	Received the package protectors today.  Took a protector out and laid it perfectly on the screen.  No bubbles. The problem is that they do not stick to the screen.  I installed one on my 4s over a year ago and it still is snug.  Maybe I got a package that has been sitting around and the adhesive might have diminished.  But since the 5 has not been out for too long, I would worry about their quality.  I just printed out a return label and will look for a better product.
0.9864145000000001	0.81248045	I just bought my wife an Iphone and got he this matte screen protector. I was skeptical at first and of course she made me put it on her new phone. Good thing it comes with three! I messed up horribly when putting on the first one, little particles of dust appeared under the screen protector. Little did I know this product also came with a sticker/tape-like thing you can use to get the dust particles off after you wipe it down with the cloth.I took the phone outside in the bright daylight to see if it actually worked and sure enough it did!
0.36292034	0.5667512	The product was good at first, but overtime I've noticed numerous scratches.  It scratches way too easily in my opinion.
0.84078044	0.8266673000000001	this is a great screen protector for the new iphone. i recently had a verizon screen shield installed on my iphone but that one was a fingerprint magnet along with greasey film from the oils from your hands. i love the anti-glare type because it hides your fingerprints and keeps the screen looking clean.putting the sreen on is easy also. as a recent reviwer stated. you may want to start the application from the top where the front camera and speaker is. i find it lines up much better then starting at the bottom where the home button is. not too many air bubbles when the screen shield is on but be careful of lint and small particals in the air. i am very fussy when it comes to a perfect installation and the install took me about 15 minutes to get it to perfection. being careful and slow and patient really pays off in the long run and makes the screen look beautiful. some commented that the screen looks fuzzy. i dont really think so but i like the idea that the screen doesnt shine back at you when looking at the display. also the screen is soo smooth when navigating. this in my opion is one of the best ones on the market thats if you like anti-glare. a must have for your iphone5.
0.9824811	0.80255985	Price point cannot be beat and it outperforms some of the more expensive screen protectors. You also get 3 in the pack and installation is easy(take your time and do it right).  If you're looking for a matte screen protector, look no further.
0.9112611999999999	0.8156039	I received the item fairly quickly. It came with 3 screen protectors. Yes, it makes the retina display look a little pixelated. This is what you get when you get anti-glare, anti-fingerprint. It works well and fits perfectly. I did waste one like another reviewer stated. Make sure to use the anti-lint tape. After I used that, I was able to get the screen protector on perfectly at that point.
0.8231773000000001	0.82362187	"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product. While ""HD"" sounds like a marketing gimmick,  the screen protector doesn't impair the resolution one bit so you still have an amazing retina screen to look at. The touch and feel is great too - it's feels like your touching the actual phone screen unlike a certain transparent shield I've used before. The one knock I have on this protector is that it isn't as durable as I thought it would be. After a couple weeks of use, the protector already has a couple of small scuff marks, mostly from being in my pocket with my keys. It's nothing that's too significant, but I'm pretty certain I'll be changing it out with the replacement screens they provide.Where they really shine is in customer service. After going through two protectors during installation, I finally managed to get the third one on correctly. I contacted them on a Sunday morning, and within minutes they told me they would replace the ones I've already used up. One week later and my new replacements are at my front door. It's the quick and friendly service that makes this purchase truly worthwhile."
0.91472757	0.8343587	This product covers the entire front of the phone well and was relatively easy to put on. It is great that they provided a dust wipe and plastic card to assist with the process. My only issue was that the cloth on the second and third use was depositing dust from the first and second phones respectively and so the second and third phones did not go as smoothly as the first did - many little dust particles were discovered after laying the screen down the first time. All but one got worked out so 2 out of 3 isn't bad and the other 2 do have little spots at the corners where I had to keep lifting to get more dust out. I would totally recommend this to others though. Price can't be beat compared to others and it has been a great cover.
0.99824727	0.8235507	This is a great screen protector, very happy with this purchase. It was easy to install and the instructions were very clear.
0.9767771000000001	0.7466414000000001	I gave 5 starts because the screen protectors are great, at a good prices.I recommend them. They fit well and stay on well.
0.9754838	0.75431323	I have used several of these over the years but none as easy and effective as this product. These guys will be my new &#34;go to&#34; for all screen prtector needs.
0.9960424999999999	0.81831247	Very Firm and Ultra Clear. I recommend this product to all iPhone 5 Owners, I tried others but this is the one that meets my requirements.
0.79090333	0.61115736	This screen protector is all I wanted, easy to install, anti fingerprint, anti glare. The delivery was on time, the only thing I have not proved is the lifetime warranty.
0.98919946	0.758749	This is exactly what I wanted and I'm very satisfied. It goes on smooth and there was no filmy residue afterwards.
0.9811573	0.70197976	Great product, it does exactly as it says and I can verify that it has protected my new iphone5 from atleast 3 gouges that would've required me to get a new screen!!
0.99659026	0.85690373	This is definitely the best screen protector that I've ever purchased. It was a little bit pricier than some of the other screen protectors, but this one is thicker and higher quality. It comes with three screen protectors, a cleaning cloth, dust-removal tape, an applicator for removing bubble, and instructions. It was very easy to put on and I can't even tell that anything is on my phone. Love it!
0.24281794	0.41627347	They do protect the screen I'll give them that. I just wish they could be put on with less air bubbles
0.97142565	0.7559971999999999	The protector film is cut to precision. There are three films in the package and one small card for application.The film fits very well and very easy to apply. I used this for two new iphone 5. Do not remove the wrapping film that came with iphone 5 until you apply this Tech Armor film. If everything is ready, peel off the wrapping film and apply this protective film immediately. In this way, you can prevent any dusts or contaminants from getting inside. If any dusts are trapped, use 3M scotch tape and gently pick up those.
0.67213786	0.5360345999999999	My initial review of this product was that I found it difficult to put on without bubbles. I did not contact the company because I figured it was my error. Within 24 hours of posting my review, I received an email from Armor Tech with more explicit installation instructions, and them telling me they wanted me to be completely satisfied and were shipping me out a new set. This company is to be comended for their pro-active approach to customer service!
0.037496984	0.59577453	very sorry I purchased this product, the pack came with three screens, screen comes with a couple removable tabs you have to take off,  the first tab pulls away the backing and the second tab is supposed to get pulled off after you've installed the screen. problem is there is too much glue under that paper tab, it leaves a residue that is difficult to remove. I tried with screen number two, it seem to go on easier, I still had to remove that glue residue and now an hour later it is already coming up on the top left hand corner.disappointed!
0.9989741	0.8621744	I just installed one on my new iPhone 5.  This product is far superior to the protector that came with my Otter Box case.  I was very careful to clean the screen of any smudges and lint and it went on perfectly.  You cannot tell that there is a screen protector on my phone.  Highly recommend this product.Update...  These last and look great for a long time.  I just purchased another pack for my wifes iPhone 5C.  Was happy to see that they had added tape to remove lint.  The best screen protectors out there!
0.98401296	0.7697176	These were just as described and work great. Very eaasy to install and provide a nice anti glare screen in sunlight.
0.9948940000000001	0.7414957	I was skeptical at first, but once I got the screen protectors...I realized that these are good quality and I love 'em!
0.93846595	0.7353986	This works as advertized, no issues-  putting it on is tricky, but they all are.  I recommend it if you're looking for a iphone screen protector.
0.5074973	0.44490853	This is what I was looking for.  I needed something to protect my screen and this doesn't look like anything is there.  There are also 3 to a package.
0.56811345	0.74627364	"ConI cant get these plastic protectors on without getting dust bubbles under them to SAVE MY LIFE.THIS time I did the steamy bathroom ""trick"" WITH an HEPA air cleaner...a bad joke...FAIL.If YOU can do it...get a job at the Mall, you'll make a killin'.ConBesides that, the ""Matte"" finish makes my reading glasses useless; adds a fuzzy factor to the screen.  It DOES cut glare though as ther is little reflection off rough surfaces.ProThe ""no fingerprint"" point is almost totally valid...bug plus there.  Not perfect...but does hide them well.ProApproproately In-expensive.  At least I dont feel horribly ""skinned"" for these."
0.91145813	0.72426295	It works great. It hasn't peeled up on the edges and my screen still looks great. The only knock I could give it is that i holds onto grease after a call. But it wipes clean on my pants or shirt so still 5 stars.
0.9860021999999999	0.66227996	Works as expected. What I really found exceptional was the speed in which the order was filled and shipped. Good job!
0.7424375	0.7537005	These were relatively cheap and have worked great on my phone.  The only problem is taking them off.  I seem to never be able to take them off.  After a year it has become a little smeary in spots, but overall this is a great value for the money.
0.9429502000000001	0.8402185	Like any screen protector, they can be a PAIN to put on.  With some practice its no big deal.  With a three pack you can't go wrong, and they don't last forever.  I used my first one without messing it up, so have 2 more for when it inevitably gets scratched.  My secret to the bubbles is this... Clean the screen the best you can.  It won't be perfect.  First, get the screen protector positioned perfectly the way you want it.  Don't worry about any dirt or hair caught underneath.  When its positioned where you want it, take a piece of tape so it hangs off one corner.  I put one on a top and bottom corner.  Grab the free end of the tape to lift the screen protector off the screen half way.  Use another piece of tape to stick any dirt or hair that is caught underneath.  Slowly lay it down and repeat until the one half is perfect.  Then do the same to the other half of the screen.  To remove the tape, don't grab the end thats free.  Unstick the end on the protector and slowly remove it so you don't warp the end of the protector.  It will turn out perfect.  It took me maybe 20 minutes.  Patience and finesse.
0.9762924000000001	0.824126	The product arrived promptly even through the hurricane. The screen protector was easy to put on and works as expected. It does not dull the brightness too much like other protectors. Definitely recommended if you don't like smudges and fingerprints on your screen.
0.99829423	0.8824084000000001	This has to be by far the best screen protector I've used, and here's why:- It comes with a cloth, dust tape, a card to eliminate bubbles, and three screen protectors.- It comes with CLEAR instructions and a link that takes you to a youtube video that shows you how to install the screen protector.- Both reading and video instructions give you the best tips on how to perfectly install the screen protector.- It took me 5 minutes -the most- to successfully install it.Now, the comments above may sound like something you take for granted or obvious. Truth is, other screen protectors don't come with instructions, hence, you may end up with a dusty screen filled with bubbles. Bottom line, this product is great because it makes it easy for the user to install the screen protector perfectly.
0.9918684999999999	0.8461586999999999	Excellent protector and easy to apply. I removed the film lined it up  over over the ear and camera holes first, as opposed to the other way around. It was easier for me then instructed. No smudges on my screen. Great product and price.
0.9614363000000001	0.71407753	This screen protector is great! It doesn't even look like I have a screen protector on my iPhone. This product also came VERY FAST, within 1 day!!
0.9976964	0.7347428	I love my screen protector! It really works and is Durable. I recommend this to everyone for the iPhone 5.
0.12812018	0.49302554	It was hard to get on even though I know how to use the credit card (they even provide them) but most of all because they weren't the right size. The sizing was definitely off.
0.85888326	0.7363443000000001	I had no trouble putting it on.  There were no bubbles and the alignment with the iphone mechanics was easy.
0.39590454	0.5951528	Shipped on time and matched the product descriptions/photos.  I wish that they came with protector screens for the back of the phone too, but for what it advertised, this is a legit product...especially considering the price.
0.9983289000000001	0.7895615	Love my iPhone and wanted to protect the screen.  Saw this Anti-Glare product which has a lifetime warranty.  It's easy to put on your phone and I am very happy with my purchase!  Will buy more in the future!
0.8726778000000001	0.8035639	Fits perfectly, not difficult to align. The matte finish is nice because the phone doesn't look dirty all the time.  Stays in place and doesn't flip up at the corners and I was able to get the air bubbles out without difficulty. (There is a tutorial online if you need it.)  Would definitely buy again when needed.
0.99983585	0.92672753	"Can't beat the price. You get three good quality screen protectors for under $7.  I actually paid $5.95, they just recently raised the price. Tech Armor always offers their screen protectors at a great price and it's nice that you get more than one in case you mess up the installation (which by the way they offer FREE replacements if you do).  Other companies charge three times as much and you only get one screen protector with them!  I've been using Tech Armor screen protectors on all my devices and haven't had any issues. They go on easy if you follow the instructions carefully (their website offers detailed instructions and videos). You can hardly tell there is even a screen protector applied (only for the HD Clear versions, the Antiglare protectors will have more of a noticeable matte finish).  Your finger can still glide smoothly across the screen, the glass surface feel is still there as if you're touching the screen with no film at all. My only complaint is that it retains fingerprint marks and smudges, just like the screen would, and can be a little difficult to wipe completely clean if you use just a polishing cloth. If you want to clean the protector and get rid of all fingerprints and leave it completely streak free you will need a screen cleaning solution with a microfiber cloth. After you spray it down you will need to ""buff"" the screen protector to get rid of all the streaks. But it's not much of a concern since you'll constantly be getting fingerprints all over the screen. I highly recommend Tech Armor for any of their screen protectors. Great value and a great product!"
0.5033979000000001	0.56567514	I know Apple has it's warranty programs but not for a scratch on the screen which can be annoying. Cough up a few bucks and stick this baby up, it would feel nice to the touch and won't worry you if the keys or whatever hazard is beside the screen. A good buy.
0.99831057	0.8044853	Privacy ensured screen protected from all angles. Stuck on well with no bubbles or issues. Highly recommended for everyone who needs it,
0.99115455	0.83746225	I had tried somef the &#34;cheap&#34; protectors and they wrinkled, had bubbles, etc. These go on easily and flawlessly. Highly recommended!
0.9349221	0.8245415	Works well without any deterioration of viewing angle or quality of picture. As long as you clean your hands and work in a lint free environment, you can place this with no bubbles or lint and it is nearly undetectable.
0.5218976	0.6916986999999999	-fairly easy to apply-resistant to smudges-very clear-best valueI was able to get a decent application after failing on the first protector. These things are a pain but they will keep your glass from becoming scratched by coins and keys and other junk in your pocket. If you're going to use a screen protector, this is a solid choice.
0.9400594000000001	0.6573727	Put it on the phone and you cant see it.  Perfect way for a screen protector to be.  Good on you Tech Armour.
0.48341069999999997	0.7107981	Great product.  The protectors went on easy and look good.  I replaced some cheap ones from Walmart that looked bad after just a few months.
0.98492867	0.78252554	Matte takes away from the iPhone's clarity. These are great, super clear, must buy! I wish would've bought these for my last iPhone.
0.983358	0.7172054	very easy to apply, product as advertised. 13 more words required, now 8, and as I type this i'm at one.
0.7473911999999999	0.8363712	First the good news:1) The screen protector is definitely clear and free of any rainbow effects or messed up retina display.  When I'm viewing content on my phone, I often forget that there's even a screen protector on it.2) It's very forgiving when you're trying to place it on your phone.  Even after watching the how-to-install video, I still messed up a few times on getting the cut outs to align with the phone openings.  But I was able to just peel it back and realign it until it got as close as possible.  I didn't have to toss out the first one and try again on the second, and the first one still works fine and looks great despite the number of times I peeled it off.A couple things to note:1) Reduced touch-screen sensitivity.  When playing games that require lots of quick swiping your fingers across the screen, I find it doesn't always pick up your movements.  I understand that some sensitivity might be lost because there is something between your finger and the glass, but this is just something I've noticed compared to previous screen protectors I've used.2) Difficult to get all the screen cut outs to align with your phone.  As noted above, I had to peel it back a few times to realign it to my phone.  The cut outs are still not perfectly centered over the phone's, but it's close enough.  As long as the screen protector isn't hanging over the phone buttons/openings, I can deal with it.
0.9991485000000001	0.8198274	Great product. Very affordable. Easy to apply and extremely functional. Great product at an incredible price. Also available for other iPhone versions.
0.049759954	0.5589211	"The instructions that come with this product indicate that there is a ""green tab"" and an ""orange tab"" on each side of the screen protector.  You are to clean the phone and remove all dust from the screen, peel back the protective plastic on the screen protector and place it sticky side down.  The problem is, there is no indication on the green tab (there was no orange tab) which of the two pieces of plastic is the actual protective cover.  So after peeling the two apart about an inch as instructed, you then have to figure out which side is sticky.  The adhesive wasn't very sticky at all, so it's not real obvious, so you peel it back a little more and it's still not obvious..  As I don't live in a sterile dust-free environment, while I'm trying to determine which is the actual protector, dust is collecting on both the phone screen AND the protector.  So I took a guess, and sure enough dust is between the screen and protector and you can't get it out with the little DUST producing cardboard squeeqie they provide to push the bubbles out.  But that's ok, because as I said previously the adhesive side isn't obvious due to the weak stickiness factor, it didn't stick to my screen anyway, and no matter how much squeeqying I did, the edges (especially around the button) wouldn't stay adhered to the phone and would bubble up again."
0.32437372	0.5623523	I got my screen protectors today and I was excited to put it on. Normally, I don't have trouble putting these screen protectors on, but for some reason these screen protectors are sticky on the top and difficult remove bubbles. So, I decided to read the instructions that came with it and I tried it again with a new protector. This one came out okay, but it has bubbles. I left the bubble alone because I was getting tired of trying again and I didn't want to waste another one. Another thing that bothered me about this screen protector is that the top layer where you touch the screen leaves behind a lot of oil when you use it. I washed my hands with soap and it helped but its makes it a little bit sticky and hard to slide your fingers across. One good thing about this screen cover is that it's very clear. I just wish it doesn't take multiple tries to get it on correctly because you only got 3 of them
0.99634063	0.8220409	Great product, easy installation.  Was pleaseantly suprised about the quality of this cheap and affordable product.  Will be buying again.
0.060673356	0.35148359999999995	I truly could not put on the clear screen without getting bubbles and lifting from the corners. This did not work for my phone or me. I will not be repurchasing.
0.9758698	0.81424063	Now I went ahead and purchased these because they have a really high customer rating and also are at a really good price for a pack of 3. The installation was very simple. So Easy I got it on my 2nd try, and this is only my 2nd installation. No water, residues or anything to use. just peel the protective film strip, align, stick, peel the front strip, and you're done. I tried the first protector and had a bit too much dust under it so thankfully i was able to start fresh witha second screen protector unlike my zagg invisible shield which only comes with one. After i finally got the 2nd try how I wanted i was very happy overall. It doesn't feel all rubbery like the Zagg. It honestly feels like nothing is there. BUT!! It doesn't clean very easy. There are always smudges left after trying to clean it.Overall It looks and feels like there is no screen protector there. There is very little to no quality loss of screen quality so the retina display is at its peak performance. I recommend it, but the only con is that it stains easily and is difficult to wipe clean`One thing I forgot to mention is that if you have a case on your phone, these will do well as there is a very small gap between the edge of the phone's screen and the protector itself. In other words. There is about 1mm or 2 of space left if properly aligned.
0.9660146000000001	0.7530408000000001	Bought it for my daughter, and in no time all her friends wanted one. It keeps the screen clean and reduce the glare under the sun.
0.6664548	0.53521425	It's a bit difficult to place, especially for those who do not have a good pulse, but meets the specified functions.
0.80753195	0.72866565	Good:1. Does not diminish the image quality of the phone (ie. does not make the screen blurry).2. Sometimes I forget its even there since it does not feel like rubber or rough like a lot of other screen protectors.Bad:1. Have to be very precise when putting it on.  You can not quickly put it on and expect a good result.2. Dust! I thought I was being careful and I still managed to get some dust caught in one corner of the phone.Overall, very satisfied with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.
0.9808418999999999	0.7847208999999999	I recently purchased this product from amazon and was completely satisfied by the service and the product.  I found no difficulty placing this screen on my phone.  I had been using another screen made by another company, and had many bubbles with this particular screen.  It came as part of a package I purchased for iphone.  When I saw the armor tech screen, I decided to purchase it as the price was great and I liked what I saw.  I have never regretted getting this product.
0.9874662000000001	0.8735409	I love Tech Armor's screen protectors, especially the antiglare/anti-fingerprint ones. They are matte and for people who really care about retina display this would not be good. However, I love how easily you can put them on, how long they last intact (I've never used a second one and have used them with iPhone 4, 4S and now 5) and how it really keeps fingerprints off my phone. After I put it on, I forget the screen protector is even there, no bubbles, no fingerprints and no glare.I recommend these screen protectors, just be aware that if you are very picky about the quality of the display and do appreciate retina display, this may not please your preferences. I for one, do not see considerable difference in the quality of the display, but definitely see a huge improvement in the neatness of my screen.
0.94672453	0.6738510999999999	I've always used Zagg Invisibleshield for my iPhone, but when I upgraded to iPhone 5, I decided to try out this product. With the Invisibleshield, they would never last more than three months and I always had to send it back in to get a new one. This screen protector is AWESOME. They apply to the iPhone so easy and they last forever. I haven't changed my original screen protector yet and I have had my phone since December. The screen looks as if there is nothing on it.
0.99056983	0.8964213	I was able to put these on both my phone and my husband's phone very easily.  It was easy to get the air bubbles out from under the protectors.  I like the matte finish.  It stays neater looking without the smeary fingerprints showing.
0.9995129	0.7835411999999999	I have never seen a clearer protector than Tech Armor's HD.  It was very easy to apply and due to my own fault I caused 2 minor bubbles towards the bottom of my phone but it's really hard to tell.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has an iphone5 without a doubt.  It is simply the best I have seen thus far!I also did purchase the Armor Tech anti-glare but I have yet to install it.  I am definitely looking forward to that day because I know I will be super satisfied as well.Great product, great quality, comes with everything you need along with handy dandy instructions, and a lifetime guarantee!!  You simply cannot beat that!
0.9847344000000001	0.8008562	I'm very happy with the screen protectors and would buy these again if needed.  It was very easy to put on and it doesn't look like I have it on.
0.25197953	0.55014706	i really like tech armor, I have bought several other cases from this company for my other phones but for my Iphone 5 this screen protector does not have the right cut outs.  I was really hoping that this would be the correct fit because of the picture that they used for this product, the cutouts looked big enough but I was wrong and now am left with a phone with the camera half covered and the proximity detector fully covered. I did not have any problems with bubbles, the instructions were very clear.  Overall I either was sent the wrong protectors or I got a bad patch and I am very upset about it.  In the pictures of the product for the iphone 5 their screens fit perfectly but my cutouts were way too small and I tried to cut them to make them bigger but it just ruined the screen protector.
0.97919	0.81264913	Easiest screen protector to put on of the different ones I've had. No bubbles on the first try. Would definitely buy this again and will buy one for my iPad if they make them!
0.9978961999999999	0.7967658000000001	I love these screen protectors. For the price, you really can't go wrong for a quality, reliable product. I love the matte finish. My only complaint is that the resolution on the screen is altered a bit after applying. Still, I am overall pleased and would buy again.
0.70231897	0.4274808	Today I received the replacement for my Screen Protector from Teck Armor. Actually it is my own fault to waste a piece of screen protector when applying to my iPhone 5, I should have read the instructions carefully before applying it. When I write a feedback on the situation I have, they immediately sent me a pack of 3 for replacement. Thanks, Tech Armor Team. Now I have a new screen protector after applying carefully to my phone and without bubble.
0.13118407	0.47195200000000004	This screen protector is just okay. The cut outs are more to one side, so make sure you peel back the right layer of plastic. Also, fingerprints are a big issue! I'm constantly wipping them off, so I might just ditch the screen protector and hope my phone doesn't break
0.950176	0.823987	This is anti-glare and it does just that. I can see my phone in any light and I practically never see any fingerprints. The fit is great and was very easy to put on, no bubbles. YES, you do lose some of the resolution quality, but that happens with any anti-glare screen protector.
0.9757515999999999	0.7702938	I am very pleased with the above product. I am glad that it came in a pack of three as the application of the first screen gave me chance to apply it several times to figure out mistakes that can be made and when I was ready I applied the second screen and with the exception of maybe a 1% of tiny air bubbles on the edges which I can live with, It looks great.
0.2397531	0.51425236	This screen protector would be great, if you could get it on straight.  It is very resistant to marks and fingerprints.  But due to the fact that the tab that lifts off the protective film is on the bottom (near hole for home button), you have to start at the home button, and inevitably, the screen protector will go on crooked.  Then when you lift to reposition, you WILL get dust/lint trapped under the film.  They should put another start sticker tab near the top (near camera and speaker holes) because as a previous commenter said, it is MUCH easier to get it on straight when you start from the top.  I wasted all three because I couldn't get it straight, and wish the sticker allowed you to start at the top.  Contacted customer service, but they were no help, told me I should not use any liquid to apply the protector.  Umm...  I DIDN'T?!?
0.20008683	0.31691584	Did the instructions step by step and even watched the video tutorial and still had bubbles! Ended up paying AT&T $25 for their cover.
0.98846436	0.8252854	These screen guards are the best.  It really is anti-glare and anti-fingerprint so that the phone is always easy to read and looks clean.
0.998258	0.8657091999999998	Very pleased with the appearance of this protector as it looks like there is no protector at all.  Stays clean and the touch is responsive.  Application was easy.  I didn't put it on perfectly, but only I notice the slight misalignment.  No worries, I have two more to get it right.  The protector is barely noticeable.  Good product...no complaints...good online support and tutorials.  Why spend more for screen protection when there are excellent products like Tech Armor.
0.6554846999999999	0.5775412	Easy to install, screen doesn't feel like there is anything on it. Hope its that easy to get back off when it's time to change it.
0.9780263000000001	0.76980007	This screen protector was very easy to apply. I did not have any bubbles. Nice and clear. I would buy this product again!
0.09290579	0.54493517	The adhesive on it not something you'd expect from a big or good brand, just okay. It can easily be scratched by any key or coins just like any chinese other sticker.
0.022561044	0.39675134	Have one toa friend and the holes did lot align as on the phone. We both had trouble installing it and in the end it looked horrible and we ended up throwing them out.
0.90088725	0.58289397	My expectations were low because I paid $6 for 3 screen protectors. But they were amazon prime eligible so I gave them a shot. There are more fingerprints visible than other protectors for other products I have used but you would have to be anal to really notice instead of enjoying your new iPhone's company. Would buy again but no need since the 1st one was easy to install and I won't need to replace it for a while.
0.8168767	0.6343924	I Work fixing phone and this product seems to do the job when applying, only thing they need is a spray. a spray to apply on screen helps and eliminates bubbles , i had to use one of my own to do this and does avoid bubbles and placing screen protector wrong but over all good product ,will recomend .
0.9937004	0.77681386	This screen protector is realy a thing. It's trully an armor for the screen and the size is perfect. I love it!
0.7251085	0.62134653	from the spec :  Removes glare and resists fingerprints to ensure maximum resolution for your RETINA DisplayBut after applied the screen protector, now the iphone 5 screen looks fuzzy and not clear as before, and looks like lost the beauty of retina display.update: The customer service is good, they mailed me the HD screen protector, it works much better. So I increase the rate to 3 stars. Thanks.
0.97948384	0.8423723	Tech Armor's screen protector is really a good one. It is easily applied, but like another reviewer noted, it does go on better if you start with the top end (openings for speaker and camera) instead of the bottom (home button) as the instructions state. They are a great buy. When I bought my iPhone 5, Verizon sold me their screen protector, which was supposed to be a universal one to fit all models. It did not come close to fitting, had no precut holes for home button or speaker and camera openings, and cost almost twice as much.  I was very pleased when I got Tech Armor's screen protector for iPhone 5 and would highly recommend it.
0.9918921	0.7267085	This thing was well worth the price. Came on time and works well. Would buy again if needed to do so.
0.9235594000000001	0.62468004	Product goes on easy if you have a little patience. The clarity of the film is very good.  I'm not sure about the durability yet, but it comes in a three pack so I'm sure it'll be worth the cost.
0.9889225	0.79193187	This is a great product. Compared to other screen protectors, this one comes at a much lower price in a pack of three. It is very easy to apply as well because you don't need a squeegee or anything, just carefully position the projector over your phone and press down from one corner to the other. My favorite aspect about this product is that it feels AMAZING compared to a bare screen and you can rest assured knowing that your screen won't be scratched.
0.69747996	0.6821661	Clear, but only realized its clarity is on the darker side after i applied the amfilm protector on my girlfriends iphone. This is a good protector, but it is not as clear as the amfilm, and the edges are more noticeable - not as flush around the edges as the amfilm, which makes this screen protector more noticeable, whereas the amfilm is truly invisible
0.58303285	0.7243859	This cover definitely does its job by protecting your screen and also blocking the view of others sitting around you so they can not look at your phone. Sometimes its hard to see when your outside.
0.789091	0.70525146	Product comes with 3 screen protectors, a small piece of hard cardboard to help roll out the bubbles, and a screen cleaner. Pretty standard application but it requires a bit of patience to make sure you get all the bubbles out.
0.95027566	0.71665317	Screen Protector serves it's anti-glare purpose, fits perfect if you line it up properly, and air bubbles kinda dissipate after a day or so... Weird.Although.. Not sure how the warranty works...Anyway, highly recommend this product if you're looking for a matte screen protector for an iPhone 5.
0.99796206	0.8353019	I love this product! And their customer service is so awesome! I had a few scratches on mine, and told them, and they sent me 3 new ones! And they don't scratch nearly as easily as other iPhone screen covers out there. And they are super easy to put on your phone and usually have no air bubbles. I'm impressed. The install kit it comes with is very nice as well. 5 stars for Tech Armor!
0.99511504	0.8065654000000001	I love these screen protectors. It does reduce screen clarity a touch, but definitely a good tradeoff for those messy fingerprints! great product!
0.8388628	0.7832668	Surprisingly this product offers amazing protection, my iPhone 5 was left on a tailgate of the truck and work and my co worker, not paying a single bit of attention just slams the tailgate and my phone slid down right between the hinges. I froze and slowly pulled my phone out after he realized what happened. The screen looked smashed and destroyed, but upon further inspection I realized it was on the screen protector that was damaged, I peeled it off and my actual screen was unscathed. Very high quality product. Highly recommended.
0.9992121999999999	0.82787967	These are some of the best screen protectors I've ever used. They are easy to install and fit very nicely. Highly recommended.
0.15285279999999998	0.48433304	I was not happy with the installation until my third attempt. Now 2 days later there are scratches on it and I haven't even put it in my pocket. Also, the matte version really downgrades the resolution in low light.
0.98790336	0.7411466999999999	They include everything you need to install the screen. I managed to get it on without a single bubble and it feels great.
0.011939913	0.6219226999999999	This product is awful.  None of the screen protectors lasted more than about two weeks before they ripped and I was forced to replace them.  There's a reason they're considerably cheaper than other similar products.
0.9966028	0.6818323000000001	if you like doing mobile banking and mobile work. and your always tired of people looking at your phone while you do these things. THIS WORKS WONDERFUL!
0.9939903	0.82986635	Easy to apply & durable. The matte finish is nice for the iphone. Was extremely easy to apply to the phone no problems
0.99374056	0.8225359	this screen protector is one of the best out there. it fits like you don't have any protector at all. real high quality of the screens picture in great detail.
0.002753228	0.36940545	The paper that was to be used to help place the protectors on the phone left an imprint and thus the protectors were all ruined. Terrible mistake to have wasted money on these.
0.9883644	0.8459578999999999	I bought both the anti glare and the HD but decided to try the HD one first. Before I put this protector on my Iphone, I could see every fingerprint and smudge. Now, I can't see any! and this is not even the anti glare, anti fingerprint protector. It was easy to put on (my 17 year old son put it on for me). It' a perfect fit and went on perfect the first try. I did read the reviews first so we did put the protector on in the bathroom while a hot shower was running to eliminate dust in the room. My phone looks clearer than it did the day I took it out of the box. No complaints from me.
0.14582601	0.46965367	This screen as as good but no different than all the others that I have used for my other iphones and ipods.  The application comes with a sticky tape to eliminate any hard to see dust which was a new feature.  However when I performed the screen application was exactly as instructed ( and I have done this so many times) the screen bubbled in the middle and was hard to remove.  I discarded it and tried a second time.  This time there was a small crack at the base which also bubbled.  Also because the screen on the iphone 5 is longer it is difficult to judge if the screen is really straight.  You can be off by just a hair and it may not line up near the top of the screen.  I wish they would put a line near the button on the 2nd film removed to help with alignment.
0.9903371999999999	0.8450318000000001	Works good no complaints it was easy to put on. I placed mine on the phone in the bathroom with a steamy shower no bubbles just was hard to align right
0.9955459000000001	0.71406126	Great and fast would buy again it just what I needed service was fast and it fit perfect no problems.
0.47585893	0.67601705	Wasn't too hard to put on.  However, the lint free cloth left more lint/dust behind than taking it off.  I used my own eyeglass cleaning cloth which did a much better job of removing lint and dust.  I used throwaway vinyl gloves to prevent any finger prints during the installation.
0.9929303	0.81995785	Lets face it, there are thousands of after market screen protectors out there.The price is great for these and so far they are very durable.
0.9932643	0.88413894	So glad that we found these. They are a bit thicker than other protectors we've used. It isn't noticeable once it's on the phone, but the firmness makes it much easier to apply than the three brands we tried on our old phones. There are no air bubbles and our fingers slide easily across the screen. Particularly happy with the price!
0.9964784999999999	0.81420326	I like these matte protectors because they do not leave fingerprints. This one is easy to install and fits perfect
0.9816790999999999	0.81717277	This has probably been the best screen protector I've purchased. At the price you can't beat it. Install was SO easy. Just read the instructions and take your time. It probably took me like 2 minutes to wipe off my phone and place the screen. I nailed install first try! One thing is that somehow a tiny piece of lint got under the screen but I just peeled up the corner, used the lint sticker supplied and it got it right off. The corner I peeled up went right back in place like I'd just installed it. I gave it a 4 star because fingerprints show up a lot but the screen is crystal clear. It's worth it all things considered. I'd recommend this to my friends.
0.9957491	0.78869724	I knew I wanted a protective screen for my new iPhone 5 - it came in handy many times on my old iPhone! - but I was worried that I wouldn't be able to install it myself since I had a lot of difficulty with the screen protector on my old iPhone. The Tech Armor screen protector was easy to install, and it looks great.
0.9653937	0.74960524	I used many screen protectors for iPhone 4s, i don't like matte finished protectors so i preferred this. But to my surprise not many finger prints when compared to previously used  clear protectors.
0.83222324	0.5869373999999999	Great customer service they are great. When I got my screen protector the cut out was not aligned and they shipped me out a new one the same da
0.97742975	0.76767814	easy to apply, no bubbles and came with some nice tools to remove dust prior to applying the screen protector
0.98652333	0.8336135	I was skeptical about the matte protector at first. It does ever so slightly alter the view but after a couple of days I was used to it, and now after more than a month I wouldn't go back. The significant reduction in oily screen and fingerprints is not to be underestimated. Even if there is oil or dirt it wipes away effortlessly. This screen protector also gives somewhat of a softer tactile feel which is very nice. No loss in responsiveness but just feels more luxurious.Bottom line: Excellent product! Loved it so much I ordered one for my iPad Mini. I'll never go back to clear screen protectors again.  Thanks, Tech Armor for a quality, I expensive product!
0.9956253	0.827069	Good for the price. Typical installation, just need a lot of patience to remove all dust particles. Included dust removal tape helped. Easy to remove oily fingerprints with damp cloth or towel. Will update on durability.
0.9954543	0.7980010999999999	I was skeptical when buying it but it is worth every penny. U can't even tell there is a screen protector on the phone. Very impressed.
0.964551	0.7196928000000001	At first I had some difficulties install the Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector on my iPhone 5 and used up all 3 screen protectors. I contacted Tech Armor, they immediately show me how to install it in details and send me another pack of protector to me. Once the Screen Protector installed properly, Its look very nice and feel good.
0.24392602	0.54377955	when placing the first protector i used the dust cloth which only added dust particles to my screen then when i placed the screen there were some bubbles and the little sticker on the protector left some residue at the bottom. All in all it is okay, scratched the second day, but for the price it is okay.
0.6075706999999999	0.6594578000000001	I ordered these over a month ago, and after a couple weeks, I hadn't received my package so I contacted Tech Armor support, who responded within an hour, telling me they'd express ship another one, free of charge.  Weeks later, I still hadn't received either the original or a replacement, so I contacted Tech Armor support again, and within an hour they replied informing me they would express ship me a second replacement, free of charge!  I finally received my screen protectors a couple days later.  Despite waiting over a month for my screen to be protected, I am not only happy with the product, but very impressed by their speedy and wonderful customer service!!
0.6714029	0.7198220999999999	Usually with screen protectors, I end up just throwing them out because they're hard to apply or they make the screen look really bad, but these are perfect! It was VERY easy to put them on, there are no annoying bubbles, and I can't even tell it's on my phone!! :D
0.6198754	0.6747631	I didn't realize how much I look at my phone from angles until I put this on it. Even when your phone is at the brightest setting, you can see text bubbles but can't read them. May prove to be bad if you have depth issues with your vision. My eyes were having some trouble readjusting, so I have to have a bright screen underneath.
0.9958787	0.7371609	Fits iPhone 5 perfectly. I swear it makes my phone look like HD it's pretty nice. Nice and smooth clear don't see smudges perfect.
0.8467020000000001	0.54513985	I am using the product now and I am not sure I like how thick/dark/matte it is. It wasn't friendly to install like another I just recently did. I have to turn brightness up in daylight more to see through it and gives me more problems seeing the screen as well.
0.99133503	0.8611175	These screen protectors are great! They are the anti-glare and anti-finger print and definately hold to there label! They are really easy to put on by yourself and even have a website you can go to, to view how to put them on as well as written instructions! I put mine as soon as I got them in the mail and I only have two pin sized bubbles under my protector. However, they do not bother me what-so-ever. It looks really nice on my phone and fits perfectly to my iPhone 5! :) And I have 2 extra!!! For the price...this product is unbeatable and I would suggest this to anyone in need of a high quality screen protector!!!
0.9804132	0.82364976	The screen protectors fit perfect, and aren't even noticeable on the screen. The cut outs are perfect, and the screen protectors feel like the normal screen.The only bad thing is when I received them, the first one went on with bubbles, and the second went on perfect, but it had some small scratches already on it. So I emailed the company, and without a problem they happily sent me a replacement pack for free! And when I received the package (in less then a week) they're was two brand new packages inside!Overall it's a great product, and they have great customer support. I would recommend this to anyone.
0.9955548000000001	0.8288426	Fit my iPhone 5 perfect, no bubbles and phones works perfect with no hesitation. Can't even tell screen protector is there
0.9319216999999999	0.7995207	Pretty easy to install-there's two protection layers on either side of the actual screen protector. You peel off one, stick the protector to the screen, and peel of the top layer. Works great!
0.997282	0.82655203	Go ahead and spend a ton of money for some &#34;quality&#34; screen protector when this is the only one you'll need! I've purchased tech armor in the past and I've always been satisfied with the quality and durability. Highly recommended company and products!
0.74571145	0.71164155	It fits good & doesn't bubble up with the case on my phone. It a couple tries to get it on just right but once its on, its good. Use duct tape to get any lint that my get caught on the protector while trying to apply it.
0.8243848	0.6017511	When I decided to get the iPhone 5 I immediately got a screen protector.  I hate having finger prints on my screen drives me bananas and this keeps them off
0.96990544	0.74161226	I get that this product has pretty much a flawless rating -- I'm sure people love it...But this totally takes away the finesse of the beautiful glass display and makes the retina display look pixelated!I really regret buying the matte -- I should've gone with a regular screen protector :(
0.7516550999999999	0.52018654	Nice, Cheap protection.Hard to install by yourself tho.Recommend taking it to your phone store for assistance.Will order some more for sure.
0.0050083995	0.51889956	I received this product and was happy I finally got it!! I open the first one after I cleaned the screen!!! I got a bunch of bubbles!! I tried smoothing it out with the card that was provided and it didn't work!! So I tried the second one, the same thing happened!! I couldn't get rid of the bubbles!! So now I'm upset and I put the third one on!! These bubbles will not go away!! Now I am really frustrated!! Somebody please help me!!!
0.40811044	0.6553991	I ruined the first one trying to remove the tab that is glued to the protector.  Finally got the tab off the second one and cleaned phone completely and the protector is not sticking to the edges very well.  I will soon have to give the third one a try!  Tech Armor stood behind their product and sent me a new package even changed it to the anti-glare for me.  The new one went on easily and looks great.  Very happy now!
0.6491371	0.42735738	Just received my screen protectors. Seems like a really high quality screen protector.  I installed the protector but despite my best efforts, I ended up with a piece of dust underneath.  I haven't changed out the protector yet to get rid of the dust but I probably will since one corner did not stick very well either.  The rest of the protector looks great though, can't even tell it's there.
0.9235815	0.7297186	I received this screen protector yesterday and had it on the phone in about 2 minutes.  I didn't watch the online video about how to apply it, but I did read the instructions carefully.  It was very easy and I had no problems with air bubbles, lint, fingerprints under the protector, etc.  As long as you do it carefully and take time to line up the edges, it's very user friendly to put on.  I have not had any issues with screen responsiveness - can't even tell that the protector is on there.The only reason that I have not given 5 starts is because I've only had it on for a few hours, so can't speak to the durability (yet).  But so far so good!
0.9098763000000001	0.764184	The protective screen fits perfectly but the other reviewers are right... You should take your time and watch the video if you can. When installed correctly you will be very satisfied with the seamless results. It is easy to clean and doesn't take to finger smudges very easily (however it is not made of magic so don't bash on it if your makeup or really dirty fingerprint shows up on it from time to time). I do find that the picture can be a little dim from time to time but that is a peril of putting a protective cover on your phone. I've had it for twenty days now and not a scratch on the screen- which is amazing because my phone swims in my purse with pens and keys. Hope you find this review helpful :)
0.21176007	0.44001412	this screen protector feels sticky once you place it and it catches residue from any fabric. I have to order a different kind now.
0.9872277	0.7804614000000001	Very very easy to install!!! Anti glare and no fingerprints are the way to go!!! Much better than the shinny ones they sell in stores!!
0.15386206	0.5565788	Both my daughter-in-law and I tried the screen protectors, and they didn't work at all. Couldn't get it own straight, and first time I put phone in my pocket, the screen protector stuck in my pocket. They were covered with fingerprints and bent trying to get them on.
0.99030477	0.87052107	I've owned many brands of smart phones over the past 8 years...always used a screen protector...probably tried them all over that time.  This is the best because it's easy to apply, doesn't scratch easily, reduces glare, hides fingerprints, priced right, and looks good when the phone screen is on or off.
0.98047143	0.7555295	I've used other screen protectors in the past, but this is the best one that I've used yet. Even the person who works at the phone store agreed that it's the best she ever saw. It's so clear that my phone doesn't look like there's a screen protector on it at all.
0.9071640999999999	0.8197061	The seller for this product is one of the best ones I have to interface with over the many years of ordering items online.  The origianl shipment was damaged by the delivery service (USPS).  It had nothing to do with their packing.  USPS delivered what looked like tire marks all over the packing.  The seller was easy to get in touch with and they sent replacments fast.Now, for the actual protetor, it is a great product.  It is extremely finger print and oil attractive, so you will send a lot of time cleaning marks off.  However, the protector does not interfere with the screen at all and when it is clean you can't even tell it is there.  Installation was easy as long as you follow the general rules for applying any protector.  I had put my phone in the same pocket as my phone (accident) and when I took the phone out, the screen protector did not have any marks on it.So, if you don't mind a protector that is such a fingerprint/oil magnet this is a great product.  What puts this over the top for me is the seller.  They should be the bar which others sellers are measured.
0.99922776	0.86708385	I don't normally review products, but I was SO impressed with this screen protector that I felt I had to. These screen protectors are amazing! Pay no attention to reviews saying fingerprints and smudges are a problem. The included cloth cleans them with little effort. And can I just say that this cloth is like magic! The dirt/dust sticks to it like glue! I have always had a problem getting EVERY piece of dirt/dust off before applying a protective screen. A couple swipes with this one, and the screen was crystal clear! As recommended by Tech Armor I watched the instructional video on applying my screen protector. YOU MUST WATCH THE VIDEO! It explains step-by-step how to apply the product with the best results. I did exactly as instructed, and it came out PERFECT with very little effort. The only bubbles were near the edge, and came out easily. I was very impressed!!! I highly recommend these screen protectors!
0.16309887	0.4832067	&#34;Unfortunately the pack of 3 wasn't as up to par as I expected. Only 2 were in good condition, the third one was already slightly peeled off it's protection screen therefore was rendered unusable. As it is under lifetime warranty is it possible to get a replacement for it? Thank you!&#34;
0.99956584	0.8228437	Fit perfectly, the instructions are great, and the included piece of tape was fantastic! I would highly recommend this brand!
0.95349526	0.76789564	I really like the anti-fingerprint, anti-glare finish.  I usually buy 3 packs because I screw up one before getting one on without bubbles on or straight.  It went on much easier than other screen protectors I've purchased.
0.17949668	0.53256035	I've just finished putting on the 2nd of the 3 sheets, and it was a failed attempt too.  On the first try with the first sheet, when I was almost finished, a glob of the adhesive film somehow bunched up near the top holes (what the h?!).  I had to lift the sheet back up to remove the adhesive glob, and when I tried to put the sheet back on, it wouldn't go on flat anymore.  I kept the sheet on my phone for a while, but then decided to replace it with the 2nd of the 3 sheets after a few friends laughed at how ugly my phone looked.  On the second attempt (the second sheet), I wasn't able to align the sheet perfectly so the right top edge is riding on the side frame of the iphone.  Thus, there's a line bubble there.  I'm not going to try to lift the sheet up like I did on the first installation because it might get worse.  By the way, the card 'squeege' that came with the package was leaving some sort of filmy stuff on the sheet which I had to wipe off as well.
0.94883823	0.83125085	Originally I was going to write a more negative review, but after consulting with Tech Armor's customer support (VERY fast email response time, by the way), I have learned that I simply didn't read the instructions carefully enough the first two times I tried to install the screen protector.Anyone who reports a sticker leaving sticky gunk on the corner of the screen protector simply has not realized, as I did not, that the HD model of screen protector has TWO protective layers. That means that the actual screen protector is sandwiched between two layers of protective plastic, so that the screen protector itself remains pristine until application is complete.You peel off the first protective layer, apply the screen protector, squeegee out the bubbles, and then remove the second protective layer. 4 stars just because the fact that there are two protective layers was easy to miss in the provided instruction booklet, but the responsiveness of the screen is still perfect, the feel is indistinguishable from the original iPhone screen, and I think it's going to work very well. A great value for the money.
0.9926193999999999	0.7637984999999999	"Very easy to apply! Did it perfectly the first try, which has never happened before. They include a lint free cloth and ""dust tape"" to make sure your device is clean and the product has the best chance or being applied properly. It fits well and I have had no issues yet! It does feel a little weird (compared to the plain unprotected screen) but it is worth it! Very happy with the product!"
0.2699542	0.5787375	The delivery was fine and all, but the actual screen protector scratches from everything. Just by using the provided squeegee scratched it. Also, the residue from the sticker in the corner is fairly hard to remove. The scratches make it hard to see, despite the care I use with my phone.
0.6962397	0.6879413000000001	Hard to get too excited over a little plastic sheet. It does its job well. The little plastic card thingie you use to get the bubbles out is larger than what you usually get; that was nice.
0.25513518	0.5091526	I have no idea why anyone would buy a screen protector from the store when they can buy these ones off amazon!!! They come with all the right tools to put this on your phone. BUY THESE PROTECTORS!
0.9552556000000001	0.72278404	Didnt have any real issues with the application.  It went on fairly easy.  Had the occasion bubble, but just used the smoothing tool and got them right out.  Just make sure your phone is clean prior to putting on.  To my surprise, I applied with the 1st protector I tried.
0.7176293	0.40031385	i liked it, very smooth it works good, it does scotch but not so bad !!! satisfied...But i think the price is not as good.
0.9859973	0.804036	I love the feel of these and it was really easy to apply.  I got my cover on perfectly but the only issue is that the cover scratches easily.
0.8959136000000001	0.775612	Pretty good screen protector, it doesn't quite go the the edges on my phone (iphone 5S), but it covers it enough as long as you have a case on it. Good price, compared to $25 at Best Buy.
0.99465925	0.76270336	Great product!  Easy to install and fit my iPhone 5 perfectly.  Having the pack of three shields will last me quite a bit as well.
0.9526735999999999	0.6858609	I am very happy with this purchase. The protectors work well. They aren't completely smudge proof, but smudges are definitely less noticeable.
0.8032784000000001	0.7507571	The product is excellent. It is sturdy and fits well on my iphone. The only problem is the edge of the case causes the screen protector to buckle up at the edges.
0.9779899	0.82930714	Great view of screen.  Clear & crisp.  My tech consultant (aka Husband) had some trouble seeing the numbers indicating front & back.  Other than that no problems putting it in place.

0.13889977	0.37986276	I went through all 3 of the screen protectors but after installing the last one in the pack, I still had bubbles under the screen.It may be me.  Going to order a different brand and see if I have better luck.  :-(
0.85631406	0.7192645999999999	I would write out pros/cons but there are no cons. The product is cheap, it arrived quickly, the instructions were simple, and you can't even tell there's a screen protector on my phone. I'm also very glad they sent 3 screens because I messed up on my first try (didn't align it properly). The second try went well and now I have a 3rd screen if this one ever gets messed up. I can't say anything about the longevity of this product because I've only had it for one day, but so far I am very impressed. 5 stars.
0.27410093	0.5509352	I like how this product is matte and keep smudges off my screen.  My only complaint is that there is no room for error when applying the product and I had to throw the first one away after air bubbles resulted from too many attempts at trying to get the correct placement.
0.99294424	0.72864985	Great product! Application was harder than described but the product works well! All cut-outs aligned perfectly to phone and product guarantee is nice to have! Very happy!
0.9985656999999999	0.91194427	The matte protectors are so much better than the glossy ones. It's easier to slide your fingers across the screen with the matte screen covers. They fit the screen perfectly and sink down on the screen nicely with little to no air bubbles. They're also really protective. I scratched my screen with keys about a month after getting these. Once I peeled the screen protector off, the screen was completely scratch free, so they definitely save your phone. I would highly recommend these.
0.79807115	0.7685204999999999	These are great screen protectors. They are very clear and I can't tell that it's on my phone. However, I had trouble applying it. The tabs are not clearly labeled and I peeled off the wrong side on the first one. On the next two tries I applied it successfully but still had some air bubbles. The problems I had seem to be because of errors I had, so I would recommend these!
0.99914706	0.8228270000000001	I purchased this screeen protector for my phone and my son's phone, and we both love it. Eliminates glare and seems to defy fingerprints! As long as you are careful and take your time, it goes on great. Highly recommended! I'm ordering the same brand for my iPad.
0.9805588	0.77764595	Fits nicely into the screen and doesn't seem like something is there. Quick and easy to install in your phone.
0.73507464	0.72156936	I love this screen protector. I have used two different products for my iPhone 5 before choosing to this one. I didn't even expect the quality and result before I actually used it.It is very easy to install, and the product by nature tries to remove the bubbles under it.The matte finish helps protecting from any kind of finger mark or oil marks. It does not leave any marks on the cover. Even if you put a mark by excessive oily skin, it is very easy to clean using just a dry cloth and it is back to the new state ! It stays like new. Moreover it comes with 3 protector in the packet. And with the ease of installation, there is less chance that someone will waste one of them. I guess it should be good for at least next 4-5 years.Only thing you will notice with the matte finish screen protector is that your screen will look little dull. I believe that could be due to it's anti-glare property as well. But that's quite acceptable to me for the bright and sharp iPhone screen :) .It is individual choice. If you don't like to make your screen little dull, then you can choose the glossy finish one from the same manufacturer. But that will catch the finger marks comparatively easily.
0.7942575	0.60675097	Very descriptive and fool proof instructions. I was always scared of putting a screen cover on the phone on my own, but this works just fine, as mentioned before , its fool proof . Only con I see is , after putting this cover  , I can see a lot more of smudge marks on the screen, which was not the case with bare apple screen. I think apple screen has some kind of anti static layer.
0.8645344000000001	0.63984424	Screen took some getting used to once I applied to armor. It appeared a bit fuzzy/pixelated after applying protector. Also took me 5 tries to get it on correctly but now it works well.
0.72434443	0.7359674	fits perfectly on the iphoneisn't too hard to get on without leaving bubbleseasy to wipe clean, but collects a lot of grease or w/e.
0.006090969	0.44871116	False advertisement!!!!! This screen is NOT a privacy protector. I had a similar one purchased from 3M for my iPhone 4 back in 2011 and it was indeed a privacy screen. This one was nothing but a dark tint for your phone. Regardless, how you hold the phone ppl around you can read your screen. I never leave bad reviews on here but this product was a 100% disappointment. DO NOT BUY IT!
0.6344123	0.6269549	I love the Defender, but the stand that came with it broke.  A ball-baring came out the 1st time I tried to use it.  I'm sure this is a fluke, because my husband has had his for a long time and it has been great.  I had to return it, along with my Defender, in order to get credit and re-order it.
0.657382	0.63222957	This screen protector is really good because it doesn't distort the screen and has a really cool matte look installation was ok and I was able To squeeze out all the air bubbles Overall worth the price go get it!
0.7578709	0.7174971	These are super easy to put on. The only thing i didn't like about it was that the matte finish takes away from the clarity of the phone screen. I didn't notice they were a matte finish when I bought them, but they are serving their purpose.
0.99773544	0.8339293999999999	This arrived very quick.  Installation was easy following their directions.  I love the &#34;dust collector&#34; that comes with this.  I only had a couple bubbles that were quickly pressed out.  It fits perfect and looks great.  And it is not showing any scratches as of yet.  The last set I bought was very scratched within a day.  I am very happy with these.  I will definitely order more.
0.7832015999999999	0.6655233	"I usually use the expensive wet install screen protectors for my devices, but have become increasingly annoyed by the eventual denting that would happen from my nails, or jumping against other hard items in my pocketbook. Even though the phone was fine, when the screen was black, the dents looked like huge craters. A definite eyesore! Finally, I caved and figured I'd try this dry install - if it didnt work, bubbled, or dented, I had two more to get it right. I never get these things right the first time, but this time I did. It went on without any dust or bubbles.I cleaned my screen very well with the included cloth, and then peeled only a quarter of the ""remove me"" film off of the protector. Using the half with the film still attached as a handle to avoid fingerprints on the inside of the protector, I laid it down using the home button as a guide for placement. I did have to peel the protector off and realign it, but no dust or marks ended up on the protector.I prefer the traction of this protector to my zagg, and the skinomi tech skin i tried as well. Ironically, this was the cheapest protector! It is not crystal clear and there is a screen distortion from the matte finish, but I like it better!Highly recommended."
0.11825606	0.49783590000000005	Works ok with 4s and Rokbed case. Overall does not stick very well. Bought two sets. Unsatisfied. I will have to back to Zagg or find something different.
0.18727735	0.47060382	Protects the screen well, but prone to getting dust trapped during the application process, which is nearly impossible to remove.
0.32300383	0.61857504	So the number one issue is that it bubbles when i put my case on. Second issue was when i dropped my key on my phone and it cut through the protector causing another bubble.
0.93566835	0.64784765	I use this with my Otterbox Defender case for my iPhone 5.  I removed the built-in screen protector from the Otterbox and use this screen protector instead.  PERFECT screen response now as compared to the Otterbox protector...and no glare!  Which is nice because I use my phone outdoors most of the time.
0.9997121999999999	0.85804915	I just got the iphone 5 last sunday and immediately went to my local walmart to buy screen protectors. i spent $10 on a pack of three. I ended up using all three in a day because they were cheaply made and produced bubbles no matter how clean i made the screen. So i went to amazon and ordered these and spent a little under $6. WOW! This is probably one of the best screen protectors i have ever used!! No bubbles and makes my screen look high def! It fits perfectly. I will definitely buy again from this seller/brand. My sister needs a new screen protector for her 4s and i told her i will order Tech Armor for her because it is the best quality protector i have ever used! all for less that $6! GREAT product, highly recommended.EDIT:These protectors are very great. I unfortunately dropped my phone but fortunately the screen was protected and only the screen protector ripped. I was having some issues and emailed Tech Armor, and they immediately sent me a replacement set absolutely free! They have amazing and quick CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They truly care about the customer. I would definitely do business with them again and recommend them to anyone! Thank you Tech Armor!!
0.10763854	0.5096194000000001	It was easy to put the cover. However there is one spot on the left hand top corner which I am unable to get rid off. Shall try with remaining two covers later!!
0.99976397	0.8659766	Fantastic Screen Protector, for a Great PriceI would recommend Tech Armor Screen protectors to everyone. It was easy to install on my IPhone 5. The clarity is great. I've tried several different brands, I will say this is one of the Better Brands, and the price was very reasonable.  (Great Job Tech Armor Team)
0.99741673	0.75677323	I Love this screen protector. It's so easy and no bubbles. This is the best experience I have had putting one on.Will recommend to everyone
0.5903971	0.7326338000000001	Used all the screen protectors and finally got it right on the last one except its starting to come off at the edges it worked perfectly for a while at least
0.9796497999999999	0.81601727	I hate fingerprints and this takes care of that for me!  The anti-glare is nice too.  Easy to apply and they give you 3!  This company makes a great protector, better than many others I have tried.  And the price was much better too!
0.99800104	0.71238464	I have used on my new IPhone 5. Fits perfect and seems to be working well. Arrived as promised. Great product, great price.
0.86985457	0.67775035	This product came quickly to my household and I was excited when I got it. The first time trying to apply the screen protector, I got some bubbles and dust and just ended up throwing it away. It came with a small piece of paper saying to e-mail them before posting a negative review, so I did! They replied in less than an hour, and told me that they will ship me a new one the next day. I am highly satisfied with not only the seller them self, but with the product as well!PROS- shipped quickly- amazing customer service- does not create rainbows or finger prints on screenCONS- camera/speaker cutout seems to be a little off center, but still works fine- seems to have a film over it, but wears away with time- seems to collect dust on the protector
0.29196066	0.5265734999999999	A little difficult to get all of the dust off the screen to install, but the matte finish is key.  Great screen protector, esp when I see iPhone screens smashed to pieces with the glass cracking off after a bad drop!!
0.9966575000000001	0.80275226	Very happy with this product.  Best screen protector I have purchased for my iPhone this far.  Crystal clear - can't tell there is a cover on it.
0.99966097	0.8961382999999999	This is a great screen protector. So clear and smooth, I can't even tell there is one on my screen! No fingerprints, smudges, and very easy to install. I highly recommend this one!
0.950657	0.6634878000000001	It comes with a couple protectors and step by step guidelines to make sure it goes on with no bubbles or fingerprints.
0.99808526	0.8127128	This was easy to apply and fit my iPhone 5 well.  I'm very happy with my purchase, I would recommend it to others.
0.9640616	0.8326336999999999	The screen protector was easy to apply and easy to get all the air bubbles out. It looks great, can't even tell its on there when the phone is on or off!
0.8695371	0.85036147	This screen cover is a very nice privacy screen. It hides the screen from people peeking. The quality is as expected. It is thick and easy to install, mine has no bubbles in it. You can see the cross hatching and the picture is slightly darker and you lose the quality of picture. These are all normal for a privacy screen, one must make sacrifices. Overall though, I like it and the benefits outweigh the consequences. In addition, it has a nice soft feeling to the screen and doesn't smudge.
0.98725915	0.8726640999999999	This product is easily the best screen protector I've ever had for a mobile device. I've tried different brands for previous phones and/or tablets, but I've never had such a clean and easy application. The screen cover looks flawless; it doesn't distort the image or colors at all, and has no air bubbles at all!
0.026806056	0.6098201	Got my order in a regular envelope, which wouldn't have bothered me that it wasn't new as stated-BUT the three protectors are the cheap .99cents kind.... I am suggesting to everyone to pay the $1-$2 more and order from tech armor themselves.
0.99951684	0.89040923	I just installed my screen protector from Tech Armor and am pretty satisfied. No error on Tech Armor's part, I am just a little too clumsy to install it without any dust or bubbles. I ruined the first one and still got a little dust under the second one. The protector definitely fits perfectly.I still have a third if the couple specks of dust bother me too much. You definitely can't beat the price and they give you great instructions with the protectors as well as a cleaning cloth, squeegee, and tape to remove dust. Even with all these tools I somehow managed to get dust under it twice. I did see a comment from them about trying to install it in a more humid room, i.e. bathroom after a shower, so maybe I'll try that with my third and final protector.Overall, great product. Definitely recommend. Try the bathroom method.
0.5481144	0.74839056	The screen protectors at cellular store were more than twice what these cost, so I ordered these for my new iPhone5.  While talking about my order at work, there were multiple people who said they'd never had any luck getting theses screen protectors on correctly so they typically bought them at the mall & had the person there get it done right.  After hearing this I was nervous, but it turns out for no reason - done on the first try!  I simply followed the brief instructions - cleaned my screen with the cloth they provided (works well) and put it on my phone as they instruct, use the card they provided to remove the few bubbles that were there and done!
0.95778745	0.7567345999999999	I put it on my wife's new iphone 5 and have not heard any complaints, so it must be good!It went on easy. I removed the case first and then replaced it.  Looks good too!
0.9895004000000001	0.8340349	Not easy to put on, card that comes in package to smooth out any air bubbles is worthless.  Works better with a credit card.  It def decreases glare and fingerprints on the screen, and doesn't mask the bright colors on the screen like I worried it would.  Once it's on I am very pleased!
0.8196882	0.7524694000000001	The plastic is durable and strong then it used with a carrying case. The picture quality is smooth and reflective of an HD quality.
0.9974076999999999	0.8365662	This is a great product and a great company who stands by their product.  I had an issue with one of the screen protectors that got damaged during installation and they instantly sent me a new without any questions.  There is a lifetime warranty on the product and I would definitely use them again in the future.
0.23461151	0.53020597	I hated the screen on my otter box. Dirt would always find a way under the screen and I would have to take it off and clean it once a day. Also the dirt was starting to scratch the screen! So I took a chance on these. I got it on and now I have no problems with dirt and if it does scratch the screen, it's scratching the Screen Protector and not my actual screen.
0.99880075	0.8553635	I've had 3 different screen protectors with previous iphone's and this was the best fitting and easiest to apply.  No bubbles at all!  installed in less than 2 minutes.  Very happy with product and will recommend to friends/family.
0.99934006	0.7168883	Awesome privacy and protection! Highly recommended for iPhone 5 owners to purchase this product. Will recommend friends and family to use.
0.99605745	0.7679212	this is the best screen protector I bought. It is a perfect and invisible solution to protect the screen..it shipped and delivered very quick, i ll buy it again.
0.15075739999999999	0.56011784	This is far from the first screen protector that Iv'e used and I chose Tech Armor based on the reviews posted here.I read the instructions and watched the videos but I can't get rid of the bubbles. It's not a few random ones but the entire surface is covered with them. The surface was spotless (cleaned with micro fiber) and I wore latex gloves while applying the protector. Having blown through all three  I am really disappointed!I have placed and order from a a competing brand. Fingers crossed.
0.99627316	0.8454594999999999	I found this to be one of the easiest screen protectors to apply. Even though protector is rigid it is still crystal clear. Its a great product and recommend it to others!
0.99423915	0.76399237	It was very easy to install and looks great afterwards.  I like that they give you three, in case you would happen to ruin one.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
0.9965944	0.8232244000000001	definitely a superior product - I've used other no-name brands on previous phones, and was very frustrated, but these Tech Armor screen protectors are awesome, and easy to use.
0.9990859000000001	0.7382977	GREAT PRODUCT BEST IVE BOUGHT SO FAR GREAT LIFETIME WARRANTY LOVE THIS GUY AND WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO EVERY ONE
0.9719453000000001	0.8361768	I have had the same screen protector on for almost three months now. It still is in great shape and I don't plan to change it for another couple months! Crystal clear protector and although it shows some scratches now, what screen protector doesn't? Definitely a good investment. Easily fits along with my speck case and was very easy to apply.
0.9832485000000001	0.73836577	This is by far the best screen protector I have ever had. I have bought many different ones but since I have found this one I will never go to another. no finger prints and glare.
0.6340134	0.5058374	This screen protector is the best I've ever had. It doesn't give any rainbow effect, you don't have to use spray solutions, and you don't loose the glassy touch screen feel. Just make sure you put these on in a dust free environment. it took me my 3rd screen protector to get it so there was only one dust speck but that's my fault not the products.
0.95087194	0.6909649999999999	was delivered timely with no issues.  Easy to apply the cover to your phone although I had trouble getting some of the air bubbles out (but that's probably a user error...).  Overall great so far and looking forward to using more in the future
0.26295352	0.5070024000000001	What do we all hate most about all these handheld devices and phones.... all the finger prints and smudges.  Not with this product.
0.12325989999999999	0.29788333	The reason I don't like it..Cause When I put it on my Iphone 5 It leave some  scratch marks , and even left marks on it..I need a screen protector that doesn't have none of that!!
0.8571902	0.7269318	This product was very easy to apply. I have only had the phone for a couple of weeks and have had no drops or damage, but it feels better knowing it is there.
0.9187931999999999	0.7867025	This product looks and feels like the expensive brands that Apple hawks, but for a fraction of the cost.  Goes on easy, stays on tight.  Only negative is the clear model does show fingerprints/oils, but does not hinder the product from its intended use.
0.9256606	0.7106128	It's pretty good.  I like it.  Does a good job protecting from glare.  There are not many fingerprints and I also think that is a good touch :)
0.9752065000000001	0.7877096	I have had this for about 2 months now and it is holding up great.  It repels smudges and scratches well and still looks brand new.
0.62900233	0.46970016	Still going strong after a month. Haven't even touched the other 2 yet. It was easy to put on. I'd buy this product again.
0.9741122999999999	0.7420318	straightforward to apply, and the use thereof has been very smooth. well priced as well. all in all, a purchase not regretted.
0.101650506	0.64231575	"I read many reviews on this product and it seemed to be the best value for the money.However, there were several issues:First, they (Tech Armor) mislabeled the product. The package did say ""matte finish"" (which is what I ordered), but it was not - it was obviously a ""clear finish"", which makes for plenty of fingerprints and glare. This was the reason I ordered the ones with a ""matte finish"". It was also not apparent, even from the instructions, how to get a clean install/application. No matter what I did I encountered air bubbles I could not get rid of.I contacted Tech Armor customer support (as indicated in the enclosed packaging materials) and told them about the mislabled product and the problems with installation. I had read another review that had encountered similar problems and that reviewer said CS sent them a replacement set.I was promised a replacement set that would be sent out ""right away"" via 1st class mail. Nothing had arrived after 3 weeks.So, I contacted customer support and was again promised a replacement set that would again be sent ""right away"" via USPS 1st class mail. Another 2.5 weeks has gone by and I still have received nothing.It's one thing to make a mistake, it's quite another to mislead the customer into thinking their problem is going to be resolved only to lead them on with e-mails over nearly 6 weeks. It's dishonest (as far as I'm concerned)and quite frustrating. I would rather have been told that I was out of luck and would have to take my business elsewhere - at least I would not have been waiting for almost 6 weeks for something that was never going to come.Needless to say I am very unsatisfied and would recommend people stay away from this seller! I certainly will not be purchasing anything from them again.**Note - Amazon's service was great. Product was delivered on time (as always). This was strictly a seller failure."
0.44433355	0.63387406	Works good stay on the screen pretty well and nobody can't see my screen. If you get this screen protect if a good one. Not that much in price to.
0.9975096	0.8388706	These are the best screen protectors I've ever owned. They been protecting my phone from everything. I really recommended these screen protectors.
0.18984303	0.45096278	The size of the film is slightly smaller then the phone. It's working for now but shopping for an alternative.
0.9939084	0.8233693999999999	Screen protector went on perfectly.  Make sure you place the right side down - the numbers on the sides are tiny.  Once it's on, your screen is perfectly clear and protected.
0.22761768	0.40948486	I was freaking out thinking that I somehow go air bubbles lodged beneath the glass of my phone...after a few minutes panicking, squeezing them out to the sides of the screen, I realized that they were beneath the new screen protector LOL which was applied successfully. Can't see the seams AT ALL and feels just as smooth as the phone screen.
0.0028083026	0.45030662	I have ordered several screen protectors for my iphone 4s before and all came with front and back covers.  This item, the the iphone5, only came with front protectors.  Extremely disappointing and was a waste of money because now I have to go buy another package that has both.  Also, the protector leaves bubbles.
0.9738822	0.8198235	"This is exactly what I was looking for.  Crystal clear.  No annoying ""blurring"" of the screen.  Of course this protector does not repel fingerprints, but it does offer a clear view of your screen.Follow the instructions - if you clean your phone with the included microfiber cloth and then immediately put the screen on the phone, it will look perfect.  Take your time and do it right.  If you end up with dust under the screen cover, you didn't do it right. Take your time.Great deal for the price."
0.10335839	0.38168404	Its not as clear as i thought it would be. Hard to put in. I ended up using all three. Followed the instructions carefully. Super hard to read under the sunlight. I wish i had gotten the anti glare if i had known that i will not be satisfied with this one.
0.70809054	0.6885676	Shipping was quick and installation was easy.  I loved the lint sticker that came with the product.  First time I've ever installed a screen protector and NOT had lint underneath it.  However, within hours of installation, the screen protector was cut right through over the screen.  I have never had that happen before.  I need to install the second of my 3 pack and see if it lasts longer.
0.7962729000000001	0.617855	Al though the product is good, it is very tough to get it on to the screen without any bubbles.
0.9867398000000001	0.8170029999999999	Order it for my T-Mobile iPhone5. Work great for really cheap price. No bubble at all, unless you too careless and drop tiny dust inside. I clean my phone really carefully and apply it on my phone. Perfect. Can't even see or feel it. Worth every penny.
0.5077115	0.5537276	Before I had my iPhone 5, I had an iPhone 4S and for the screen protectors I bought they were under $3 and they worked out pretty nice. So This screen protector is a little pricey then what I'm used to but I bought it for the hd quality. Which I haven't really noticed a big difference. I did have a problem with getting the screen protector to align with the iPhone, this product doesn't cover the phone entirely.On the first try I had problems with air bubbles on the side so I gave it a second shot, big mistake. I ended up getting a lot of dust bubbles and now am wary to use my last screen protector.
0.84972346	0.7413228000000001	clean your phone with a little ethanol and dry with the lint free clothapply the sticker starting at your home keyeasy to line up, no issues with bubbleno loss of swipe functions
0.47166935	0.6552165	I was hoping the it would be crystal clear, but its because of the matte finish, but it does protect.  easy enough to put on.
0.46978825	0.6059140000000001	the screen protector is ok, i just had a little trouble when applying the screen on my phone since the second layer was attached to the screen protector so tight that i had a hard time to detach them, lead to some bubbles
0.27081713	0.2675898	Followed the video & written instructions but I still had a couple of bubbles.  Could just be my application skills.
0.9946438	0.81038046	Just what I wanted. Matt finish is smooth and it's easy to install, with everything included in the package, definitely worth the money you pay for it
0.9330885	0.74613345	We have ordered this brand for the iPod and now my phone.  I love the anti-glare and anti-ringerprint matte cover.  It doesn't get as dirty and has a better feel than a glossy cover.
0.38440466	0.528976	My mistake was to peel the wrong side first.  It ended up bubbly and I spent a long time trying to scrap the bubbles out before finally peeling the second side of and realizing I had it on upside-down!  I used the second of three in the package to give it another go, and it worked beautifully. :)
0.018351257	0.26780504	I have resorted to not using a screen at all and had to discard the screen I attempted to install.
0.9977653000000001	0.80230373	Worked like a charm. Easy to apply and seems to be good quality. Fits perfectly and looks good on my new iPhone 5.
0.0057879984	0.33084524	I purchased this product for my iPhone 5 thinking it was the same product I purchased a year ago.  Unfortunately, it was not. It was a lot worse.  I had an extremely difficult time putting this screen protector on.  It is not like the gel ones that instantly absorb your the air bubbles. Instead, it created many of them and I would be better off leaving the screen protector on that came with the phone.  The holes also do not match up, so when I turn the front camera on it is blurry.  It also does not come with a protector for the home button, which I know gets very dirty over time. I wish I had looked into which screen protector I had purchased last time because this one was a waste of my time and money.
0.99800277	0.7671549	I am very happy with this screen protector. It was easy to install, and you can't even tell it's there. Perfection! I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.
0.98146194	0.78157955	Ive always purchased other brands for my glass protector and paid a lot more money. I received 3 covers and they are excellent. It took me 3 minutes to put on with zero bubbles. Didn't even know it was actually on the phone, it looks great. Fast delivery.
0.9698752	0.5165666	Easy to install, can't tell it us on the screen.  Love jt so far, if things change I will update
0.9905347	0.8576733	I've ordered Tech Armor screen protectors before, for Kindle and Droid phone, as well as Iphone. I was looking for anti-glare since I am often working in the car or outdoors. This screen protector does just that and also prevents finger prints. I also like that the texture of the anti-glare shield allows for more accuracy when typing and also prevents fingerprints.
0.9987786	0.81638384	Great screen protector- doesn't leave smudges and cleans easy. Great price and quality for 3! I would highly recommend this product for your iphone5
0.7302973	0.6703785	My husband got a new phone and it didn't come with a car charger, so we saw this one and it was made my AT & T.  Which is who our service is with, so thought we'd give it a try.  Fits well into phone.
0.95318556	0.7351161999999999	I HATE SMUDGES AND PRINTS ALL OVER MY SCREEN! One of the downfalls with having a smartphone, but with these screen protectors the smudges are GONE!! I can wipe all over the screen and NOTHING! I LOVE IT!!
0.9969671	0.8939658000000001	I am super excited about these screen protectors. This is my first iPhone previously I had a droid. I went through tons of screen protectors for it trying to find ones I liked the feel of but were durable. As with any dry installation you have to be sure the screen is perfectly clean but a nice feature of these is it comes with some tape you can use to get the final dust pieces off prior to applying the protector. My first on went on perfect. I was excited about the product then but yesterday I had to remove a giant bush from our back yard. I kept my phone in my pocket and was constantly wiping away small stickers and pieces of the bush. I expected the screen protector to be trashed. Today, only one tiny scratch in an area that I will never notice. It went on well, feels perfect, does not distort the screen and is durable. No need for a lifetime guarantee, I will happily purchase these again when my screen protector needs replaced.Edit:So it has been months now, close to a year. Both my wife and I have replaced our screen protectors multiple times. Some due to scratches but mostly just due to needing to replace our phones. Either because of broken screens or buttons (specifically the power button). I have not bothered with the lifetime guarantee because these have performed as or beyond expected. I am happy to pay over and over again  when necessary. Never has it been a fault of these screen protectors. Still 5 star. Great product. Do not hesitate.
0.92544997	0.7783021	I bought this screen for my new iPhone 5. Normally I don't like putting anything on my phone because I feel it takes away from the design of the phone. I hate screen protectors and cases... especially ridiculous over-sized cases that basically transform a phone like the iPhone into a brick you can use to kill someone.That's the rant. BUT living with a 2 year old who managed to scratch the heck out of my previous phone in less than 5 seconds I have reconsidered. I bought this screen protector and so far it worked great! I really have no complaints, you barely notice the protective film being there, it doesn't take away from the beauty and clarity of the screen and it really does protect the screen from scratches.Bottom line: I would buy it again and I would definitely recommend it.P.S. Hey, psst! If you're looking for a minimalistic case for the iPhone5 that doesn't transform the device into a ridiculous brick try this: http://www.amazon.com/SF-Matte-Black-Feeling-Unlocked/dp/B00993E8B6/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1361551836&sr;=1-1&keywords;=ringke+slim+iphone+5  I love it.
0.99720037	0.8254874	These have been the most easy screen protectors to put on my phone that I have ever tried.  And I honestly forget that I have a protector on because it fits so perfectly.  I have the Elago Slim fit case and I love the combination of that with the protectors.
0.99681675	0.8202888	These are a good price and went on very smoothly. I am pleased with these and would purchase them again!
0.99822253	0.79988	Great product and easy installation.  Shipping was quick as well. This is my first iphone so I wanted a screen saver that would last and be easy to install.  I got both with this product.
0.9858714	0.6494321999999999	I simply loved how quick the item was transported.The iphone cover came safely in one piece. I love it.
0.06394595	0.31529897	The first protector I applied incorrectly and it was horrible, annoying, and I regretted the purchase. However, after actually reading and following the instructions, the second protector went on without any issues whatsoever. There is much debate about whether or not an iPhone even needs a screen protector, but my thought process is that it can't hurt, and for not very much money, the extra protection seems worth it. If I needed to buy a screen protector again, or if a friend asked, I would recommend this product (in addition to also recommending following the instructions).
0.9519148999999999	0.75293124	The screen protector was of good quality. Fits well with no air bubbles if know how to apply it.Good deal for the price.
0.9633495999999999	0.77141	I had ordered a replacement 1 week back and very promptly they sent me one in 5 working days. Excellent Customer Service, not only did they send me a replacement, but they sent me a HD Clear one to the one I bought which was Anti-Glare, because although the Anti-glare works under bright sunlight very well it reduces the quality of the iPhone's Retina Display. Very very happy & I'll definitely be buying from them again.Thanks once again Tech Armor.
0.7843356	0.69692487	I hate having fingerprint smudges all over my screens and this screen protector did it's job! No oily fingerprint on my phone now! the installation was pretty easy..just a bit confusing to get it around the top to be even.. it came with three and my second try was a success! Great product!
0.9936563	0.8563965	As soon as I got my iPhone I went to the nearest store and bought the cheapest screen protector I could find. After a couple of months I was sick of the one I had as I realized that it inhibited the touch screen sensitivity. I'm happy to say that after installing the tech armor screen protector I feel like I have a whole new phone. My finger glides very easily across the screen and the response by the phone has been fantastic.I've had my fair share of electronics that needed screen protectors and I'm just so bad at it I either take it to best buy and pay them to install it or I deal with the bubbles that will inevitably be left. However, I was able to install this screen protector on my iPhone without any bubbles! I did have to use the dust removal tape once and I even had to reposition the whole thing but eventually I got it installed perfectly! Now have I have two spares! I highly recommend installing in a steam-filled bathroom as I think that helped tremendously.
0.94355744	0.78685117	Performs very well!!! kinda hard to apply, too many steps. But once on, it stays on!  I always seem to not be able to put it on straight so I end up with fuzzies under the cover. It is very protective! I would recommend!!!
0.9959969999999999	0.85172415	Others have provided detailed instructions for applying this, so I will just stick to how it actually performs.I have used many other screen protectors, including the screen protector that came with my Otter Box, but none compares to this one.  It is the only screen protector I have ever used which doesn't peel, bubble, or need to be replaced within a month.  I have yet to see any scratches or problems with it, even with very heavy use!The matte finish really helps when trying to see the screen in outdoor light, and fingerprints are practically invisible.  I was so impressed with this, that I actually placed an order for another one today for a different phone model.  If you have a phone, you really, really need this!
0.9727089	0.7805407	I really like this screen protector much better than the standard protectors that come with some of the cases. The anti-glare is wonderful and it doesn't show the smudges as easily.
0.19209573	0.53346324	THe thickness of the protector is great, but even with cleaning the screen, I couldn't get all the bubbles from under the protector, so defeated the purpose of having it. Have two more to try again.
0.986454	0.8801136999999999	"Got the product tonight, installed on my iPhone 5 and my wife's. Needed a total ""clean room"" environment to put these on. Cleaned, cleaned and cleaned the phones with the supplied cloth. Went to install, minute skin flakes, dust particles, fibers that get on the protective sheet are there for life! Had to keep blowing air to blow them off the phone's surface, still managed to get some kind of fiber stuck on the sheet. Instructions aren't really clear. There is a very small ""1"" and ""2"" on each protective mask. Make sure you clarify that you are putting ""1"" on the surface. Ruined the first one with dust from the kitchen tablecloth and had to throw away.The instructions should state that you need to use nitrile gloves, have a lint free surface and have a clean room like environment to put these on!UPDATE*****After a hour after posting this review I was immediately contacted by Tech Armor to try and rectify my issues! After explaining my issue of getting dust and skin particles on the cover they suggested that I try installing in a humid environment like a bathroom where there is a hot running shower to cut down on the dust. Clean the surface and wash your hands before attempting install. Anyways they contacted me and immediately sent me replacement products. I was able to install the product on my iPhone 5 and its been wonderful, optically clear and protective. The product is good the Customer Service is AMAZING! I am changing this review from 2 to a full 5 stars and will totally consider buying Tech Armor products first before anything else on Amazon! Thanks guys!!!!"
0.9825949	0.7487248000000001	screen protector was easy to apply. by following the directions, i was able to get it on in one try.  looks and feels great!
0.9421289	0.7787415	I've used these types of screen protectors on other products before and this is the first time one has gone on this easily with no trace of bubbles left after I followed the instructions to squeeze them out.  It's very clear and I can't tell any difference in touch sensitivity compared to no protector.  I liked it so much I just ordered a pack of Tech Armor Screen Protectors for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.
0.8797124	0.7161823	These screen covers work very well.  I actually got it onto my phone without any bubbles or dust spots! I think I need another set for my iPad.
0.9976393	0.83219206	Tech Armor clear Screen Protectors in the 3 pack are great.  Very clear and you can not even tell you have a screen protector on.  Easy instructions (even though I did mess up on one) it was all my fault.  The 2nd application was smooth and looks great.
0.89735305	0.7581741	A great product! First time in history I was able to apply a screen protector with getting bubbles underneath, or killing everyone in sight due to anger! Just use tape to remove dust/debris that causes bubbles and you are all set. I now have two spares/back-ups! Great product/great price!
0.99032545	0.7285608	This product was really great, it took me 4 tries to get it perfect fit. They had sent me a new set and it took 4-5 days to get to my house. Over all it really great product.
0.11078194	0.49126154	I took away a star because the instructions i had were bad.You are supposed to peel off a clear film from side 1, place it on the phone and then peel off a film from side 2. Well, both of my 'sides' said 1. Bad labels i guess. so i did it wrong the first time and had to throw away 1 of the 3 protectors.  I am not too bothered because they usually last me a year anyway.
0.9975859	0.7493041	"In addition to wanting to protect the screen to my iPhone from scratches, I want to protect my screen from busybodies. I take mass transit and have caught people from time to time looking over to see what I'm doing. At any given time I could be writing in my journal, answering an email (personal or job-related), playing games, etc. and would like to do so in private.  The Tech Armor privacy screen is perfect. It has a scratch resistant tinted cover that protects from 4-ways should anyone happen to ""lean over"" to see what you're doing. It's a good way to keep your private information, private. I would definitely recommend this product to other people. Great job Tech Armor!"
0.9879476999999999	0.6922010000000001	Tech Armor provides amazing customer service and they will make sure that you are happy with their product. Although I had trouble assembling it the first time, the second time around I was able to install the screen.
0.9889205	0.663231	Smooth, scratch free , clear screen. Love it till now;. Hope for durability. I recommend it for the price too
0.9535218000000001	0.6951596999999999	Serves the purpose and is very easy to install. No bubbles ..No Hassels...I like it and I would recommend it.
0.0073209703	0.48884046	This is a waste of money.  The film doesn't go on right and leaves bubbles. I wish I knew who the old manufacturer was for the product I used on my old iphone screen.
0.9986035	0.8252149999999999	This screen protecter is better than I anticipated. Very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend to others with an iPhone!
0.99953246	0.7910349	They are great. Blocks glare so well. Helpful instructions for applying. Arrived promptly. Couldn't be happier. Highly recommended. Thank you!
0.99007034	0.82052505	Easy to install, received very quickly, and looks great. Price is fitting since you get more than one. Much better than other screens I've had in the past.
0.86629224	0.66038096	Best screen protectors I have purchased. Additionally, they come with a cloth and something similar to a credit card to clear bubbles.
0.99537957	0.78511155	Work so well! And installation is very easy! No one is able to see what I'm doing. It's definitely worth buying.
0.9967204	0.7840377	Package arrived quickly.  The screen protector was easy to apply to my phone.  It works great and I would definitely buy again.
0.9993981	0.9013245999999999	The no glare phone covers work great! My husband likes the sleek look of a regular screen protector and swore I would regret purchasing a no glare screen protector. So it really depends on the person. I love it. It works great when the sun is out, I can use my phone without any glare.  it also works great at showing no finger prints. I would recommend these screen protectors.
0.9966023	0.75239	Exactly what I expected for my new iPhone, easy to put on and love the cleaning pad that came with it.
0.98101485	0.8122130999999999	If you like a screen protector that doesn't show every little smear from running your finger across the screen, then this is definitely for you.  I was able to apply the protector without having any air bubbles.  Very pleased with this purchase.
0.70395124	0.52210623	Perfect around nosy little children! Or people in general! People thought I would be tapping a black screen when I was really texting. That's how protective it is from the sides. It would have looked better on the black iPhone though and my phone is white. That was the only thing that bugged me. But it's not the products fault.
0.99902517	0.8184303	"Excellent product that works exactly as advertised.  If you follow the directions, you should have a perfect fit with no bubbles.  I've used other screen protectors and always screwed them up, but these came with a tools to ""iron out"" the film after laying it on.  Also, the full vibrancy of the iPhone's screen comes through.  I am very happy with this excellent screen protector."
0.9815623	0.86598015	These do exactly what they say! No glare and no finger prints! Plus my makeup doesn't stick to the screen as it has in the past with other protectors. DEFINITELY GET THESE!
0.92293537	0.72997147	It arrived very quickly. It is hard to get it perfectly installed, and now there are tiny bubbles under the film around the edges.
0.07152712	0.45612562	After I put it on my iPhone. Results??? I do not think this is anti-fingerprint. I can clearly see my fingerprints on it. And size is a little shy on the sides. That's all. I'm disappointed.
0.9987109000000001	0.8617598	Protects and provides the privacy I need and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen abilities the phone has. I highly recommend this product to anyone.
0.9703135	0.77241445	So far this has been a great screen guard!  I haven't had any major catastrophes happen yet, but it seems to be a quality protector.  The pack comes with three, which was great because the first one I tried to install was definitely a practice round.  It comes with instructions, a smoothing card, and dust tape which really help out when installing!  It took a few tries to get the holes to line up with the home button and the top speaker, but in the end it only took me 20 minutes to install these on two phones.  I will definitely buy again if necessary.
0.9992074000000001	0.9023868	This is a high quality screen protector (3 to be exact), that is offered by a Customer Driven Company (Tech Armor) at a very reasonable price! You must take the time to read the instructions... better yet... watch the instruction videos on TechArmor.com.  If you follow their instructions... with patience and NO short cuts... you can install this beautiful... nearly invisible... High Quality Screen Protector in about 15 minutes. At my age ... my eyes and hand coordination isn't what it used to be... but even I installed this cover with NO visible dust or air bubbles by following the companies installation instructions!  My bride loves this Quality Screen Protector on her phone and we will recommend this product to others.
0.9937937	0.8280029000000001	I always get a screen protector, and I am really happy I decided to switch from glossy to matte this time. I don't see any loss of color or clarity in the screen, and you get the added bonus of anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. You still won't be able to see clearly in direct sunlight, but I have found it much easier to read when out and about during the day. This screen was very easy to apply - I was able to apply it in one try.
0.9909055	0.8055141	love it. ITs better than others I have used. screen is pretty oliophobic. No finger prints. screen clarity is good.
0.99836457	0.7899638000000001	Ordered these again for my husbands iPhone 5 definitely need these for phones so buy them they works great and are affordable
0.9939018000000001	0.78722686	Great product, price and quality.  Saw similar product in celluar store for double the price.  Would buy this item again.
0.972316	0.7411911999999999	Item was exactly what I expected its high quality and a lifetime guarantee. Very cool. I has no problem putting them on. It doesn't lookalike one is even on my phone.
0.9928540000000001	0.6352005999999999	I am loving it and it is worth it to purchase this.I have purchase this  company product and its really good.
0.6359099	0.60811305	Holds up pretty well, but I'm bummed that it reflects so much, and gets scratched/gouged with everyday wear and tear.
0.9972725	0.89037335	These are by far the best screen protectors out there. You get the best price for the best product. None of these are ever easy to install, and this one is no exception; however it was better than the others I have tried. The Matte finish is the best with no fingerprints and no glare. My fingers just glide over the keys. I will never buy another brand again.
0.33045159999999996	0.5049442	product doesnt fit screen all the way and is not smudge proof but overall value is worth it for purchase.
0.9715438	0.73616827	I chose the anti-glare as I am outside a lot and a review said it was easier to apply. I used all 3 enclosed sheets before I was able to apply somewhat correctly. There are still some bubbles and lint areas but I had no more sets to apply. My last phone I took to Best Buy and had them apply their shield. I will do that in the future as this was not worth the trouble and stress. Note I like the anti-glare function--it works well outside. I have had it on my phone for about a month. I would rate this as a 4 or 5 star if it was easier to apply.
0.99626654	0.85386324	I purchased this tech armor screen protector for my new iPhone 5. I have used previous, more difficult and expensive brands before. This cover was easy to install and went on with no bubbles in just seconds. They also gave you extra covers as well. The Matte finish is nice and does cut down on the glare from the glass. I will definitely look for more products from tech armor for future products.
0.69980884	0.6693448000000001	This screen protector comes with a light sticky sheet to REALLY get the dust off.  I've put screen protectors on a multitude of devices and the sticky sheet to get the dust is the deal maker.  I'll buy this one again and look to Tech Armor for my other screens.
0.9707333	0.7300171999999999	Had a problem with one of the screen protectors, customer service did an outstanding job handling the matter.  I am more then happy with the results.  If you need a screen protector they are definitely the ones to buy it from.
0.94537055	0.656035	Its very nice and good product to use as a screen protector .So safe to use this and gave protection to my phone from scratches and dust.
0.92636514	0.4423885	This is an excellent product. Sorry for my earlier review. I did a mistake while installing the product due to which I wrote the review and complained. But now the customer service responded back and showed me my mistake. Due to this, I am able to use the product very well. And I recommend this product to everyone.
0.9747950999999999	0.77066463	Very easy to apply even with the 1st attempt. No air bubble. The key is to make sure the screen is clean with no dust, oil etc. The white iphone5 looks fabulous with screen on.
0.94763243	0.77031565	It is very good screen protector; truly clear screen protector. I watched manufacture's installation instruction video, and installed the screen protectors. I have 2 phones. I installed it on first phone successfully, and looks nice and clean. It did not go well on the second phone; lots of bubbles. I tried to follow the instructions to remove the bubbles, and did not turnout good! I contacted manufactures customer service, and they stood by their warranty, and sending out a replacement. That's called customer service.Installing the screen protector requires some skill; simple for some! Many cases bubbles are because of the dust, but in my case bubbles are the air bubbles. They send a squeegee for removing air bubbles. I need to learn better to install without air bubble in the first place, and how remove inevitable air bubbles.
0.9838699000000001	0.677163	Good. I have no problems with it, it works great, I would definitely buy it again if I had to
0.8266386	0.6673286	Installation was fairly simple. A couple of small bubbles near the corner. When you take of the final tab, be sure to be careful not to lift the film. Good protection for your phone.
0.097881645	0.43941499999999994	I cannot say that the screen protector is the problem. I bought this with a Belkin case and after applying the proctor and putting on the case it bubbled all over. I used all three of them and it happened each time.
0.99767375	0.824314	Fairly easy to put on yourself. Great price and it works just described. Can now walk around without worrying about my screen getting scratched!
0.84455043	0.7004541	I got the screen protectors for my fiancees iphone 5 and so far so good. They fit a little smaller than the screen itself, or so I though, but she doesn't have a problem with it at all. Easy to put on too
0.8867408999999999	0.5286448	Product is amazing. But make sure to watch the install video. It took me two tries to get it right.
0.988698	0.76353633	The protectors came in a bit early which is always great! It came in a pack of three which is very handy. The protector itself scratches and covers most of the phone. I very much recommend these screen protectors!
0.5343405	0.61754936	Easy to install and seems to work as advertised. The screen protector is simply a sticky film you place over the phone. You must be careful not to allow lint or finger prints to attach to the film before putting it on the phone.
0.6938008000000001	0.7259538000000001	I have had bad luck with screen protectors but so far I like this one. It is easy to apply and comes with dust removing tape which made application even easier. I think I will pay a little more for the anitglare type of this same brand only because this protector gets a bit smudged looking sometimes. Other than the smudging it does not effect the quality of the display.
0.9501884	0.7913264	I put it on my phone and didn't have much problem putting it on, the lint sticker thingy helped a lot, I love how it's matte also, doesn't pick up any fingerprints!
0.38271236	0.6574281	I was absolutely shocked when my first (and only) attempt at putting on the product resulting in a near perfect placement!It did end up with two bubbles (one near the home button, and another a half inch above)  Following the slightly confusing instructions I managed to use the push-card to flatten and squeeze out the two bubbles!  Unfortunately I found that my placement ended up deviating a millimeter or two at the very top, but it's not worth pulling the shield off for another try, as it doesn't block the front-facing camera or speaker.The fact it came with THREE was great, as I've ALWAYS had trouble with bubbles, oil, and dust somehow getting between the screen and the protector (even when washing the screen and my hands (also kudos for the dust-sticker!)
0.9886004999999999	0.81878525	It fits my i5 perfectly. And the trick that someone recommended to install under the vent hood to help with dust was extrememly helpful.  My only issue was that the first try I put the protector on upsidedown because it wasn't labeled well to say which side was which. But once I figured that out, I abandoned the first one and tried again and it came out perfectly. That's why I always buy packages of at least three of this type of product, because I always screw upo on the first try.  It's a great product and was definitely worth the price.
0.99189615	0.7426982	The package came with 3 protectors, which was a nice bonus, since I didn't notice that in the description. The protector is easy to apply, everything I need is included. The film itself is practically unnoticeable, so everything about this product is perfect so far!
0.71845746	0.5721006	It serves its purpose but the protector is kind of foggy? Probably because it is anti-glare but it definitely mutes the colors and pristine quality of anything you view on your phone.
0.97407424	0.73400986	I was able to apply the cover on the first attempt. Just be patient and careful. I recommend this product.
0.0027393997	0.56293947	False advertising - not a privacy screen, just a regular screen protector. I should have read the other reviews before buying - none refer to a privacy feature.
0.9829298000000001	0.8460996	This works perfectly. The price is right and the quality is top notch. I cannot see from ANY angle. It did what I expected it to do: it lowers the picture quality. Oh well.
0.9855461	0.779315	So I must say I applied them wrong and ran out of the 3 pack the first time I put them on since I was in a hurry. Tech Armor was nice enough to send me a new pack over my stupidity. Andddd they also have a lifetime warranty so if they ever tear or anything you can contact Tech Armour. I've had my HD premium screen protector for about two weeks and it is looking amazing zero scratches looks flawless. I totally recommend this product for it's quality and a brand you can trust.
0.9266412	0.76233256	I was concerned about fit and loss of screen sensitivity but so far so good. There are good directions for setting the protector in place. It is super important to keep dust particles off the screen while settling it in place to avoid air bubbles. I managed to get one bubble next to the top edge that I decided I would live with. I don't have any noticeable loss of screen sensitivity.
0.4945523	0.6113982	Followed all the basic tutorials on how to apply the screen and it worked fine. My only issue was that when I tried to put my outer cover the screen came out from one of the corners. However this is more my mistake. So overall seems like a good cover so far.
0.9773970999999999	0.8492311	The sticker is very easy to apply and stays very clean. The HD screen protector is veyr clear, you don't even notice it's there (it even looks better than it did before haha)!
0.87121344	0.753641	There is nothing spectacular about these screen protectors but they seem to do the job.  I had a great deal of trouble putting them on and was left with tiny bubbles no matter what I did.
0.66371083	0.6869821	I was really happy to see that I found a screen protector that protects the entire face of my iPhone, save for the button, camera and earpiece that wasn't anti-glare and would retain the crispness of my screen.I thought it would be simple to put it on my phone, because I used to put screen protectors on tablets all the time at my day job but unfortunately, I had a few hiccups. Mostly issues with dust getting under my screen, but I guess I should have looked through the reviews for people's tips. I ruined the first two with dust and accidentally denting it and the third one, I got so close. It looks great on my phone except for at the bottom of my home button because that's where I was lifting up to get at some dust under the screen.Except for the imperfections that are making my OCD tweak out, the screen looks and feels great. Yes, it smudges but that's what the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint films are for. I wanted to retain my glossy screen. I'm thankful that the pack came with three so I got one to where I can live with for a little bit.
0.9938431999999999	0.74370664	This is a great product...I've had no negative issues with it so far.  Note - It's best to put this thing on in an area free of dust!!!
0.99727666	0.84250605	"I own three touchscreen devices and have ordered screen protectors for each of them. I was especially impressed with the Tech Armor protector for my iPhone 5. This manufacturer provides 3 screen protectors. (Good idea, since you will rarely get the application bubble-free on the first try.) The packaging also includes a dust cloth, dust removal tape (a really helpful item to have!), and a sturdy ""credit card"" to smooth out the bubbles. The application went smoothly and is bubble-free. And I have two remaining protectors in case I need them in the future.Overall, Tech Armor delivered a very good product that does the job as advertised. You can't go wrong with this purchase!"
0.9751832	0.43274325	An excellent product produced by a company which has integrity.  Instructions, customer service, return policy exemplary. Application method best in the business.  Very highly recommend this, and any other products this company may produce.
0.8490329	0.7409471	Pros:This is a good clear screen protector.  It is slightly (minutely) shorter in length than the iPhone 5, which actually helps it fit under a case.  The film is thin enough to fit under cases, but thick enough to give good scratch protection to the screen.  It does not cause the screen to appear blurry or otherwise detract from the awesome resolution of the retina display.  After applying the screen protector, I did not notice any decrease in touch sensitivity. The holes (cutouts) line up well.  There are 3 screen protectors in the pkg, so if you mess up, there are 2 more in there.  The Bubble card and cleaning cloth do a good job of getting rid of the bubbles.  They also come with a lifetime warranty.Cons:Face oils and fingerprints stick to this screen protector much more than they do to the screen of the iPhone 5.  I have to use a cloth to clean the screen protector daily.  The second problem is that no matter how much I worked at it, there was one bubble on the edge of my iPhone's screen protector that I just could not get out.  I used the dust tape.  I followed the instructions.  I removed it and tried again.  That one spot has a small bubble that will not go away.  After 30 minutes of fussing with it, I decided not to care and I still have that screen protector on my phone.  I could try again with the 3rd screen protector, but then I would be without a spare.  When the phone is on, you can't see the bubble, so it's not a huge deal to me.  You can only see the bubble when the screen is dark.For what it's worth, we have the same screen protector on my husband's iPhone 5 and his went on with no bubble.If I could, I'd give this 4.5 stars.  I'd like more consistency on bubble-free application and a more oleo- and fingerprint-phobic screen protector without loss of the HD screen clarity.
0.9546144	0.80189943	This protector is easy to install - but make sure you are in an area where there is no possibility of any miniscule speck of debris that could land on the screen as you install.  I made sure screen was perfectly clean of fingerprints and shined like a mirror and unbelievably with my luck, not once but twice, I had a teeny tiny speck of something wind up beneath it just as I put it on forcing me to remove it both times.  Argh!  Next time I'll do it in a room without any ceiling fans in the vicinity.I haven't tried the third protector yet, but it oddly had a small air bubble in it when I took it out of the package and I was already frustrated with myself for screwing up the first two.Overall, they were easy to peel, then drop right into place.  I've previously put it on a Samsung Galaxy S3 without any problems,
0.99816304	0.89644665	Very impressed.  Easily applied and truly glare free.  Even fingerprints don't show. Does not interfere with &#34;touch aspect&#34; of the phone!  Recommend highly.
0.12463358	0.5488499	I wish the description would have told me that the Touch ID  feature would not work with this phone cover. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. Other than that it is a very well made and protective cover as I would have expected it to be since it is an Otterbox.
0.99930155	0.88704836	The tech armor product I purchased for my iiphone five, antiglare and matte finish screen protector is excellent. Fits like a glove and I would recommend to anyone
0.9951837	0.8274679	I've had several screen protectors. My last one I could not see the screen when in the sun. This one is great, and highly recommended.
0.87630904	0.6453388000000001	These are hands down the best screen protectors I have ever bought. Installation was a piece of cake and the screen is not effected at all buy the screen protector. Would buy again.
0.12833872	0.69882345	When the cover is applied it applies perfectly, but once you put on a case it causes the screen to bubble. I called the company twice for assistance and emailed several times with no reply.
0.99487424	0.76962686	Just got this in today and what can I say but WOW they are awesome, extremely clear like nothing is even there. Installation was easy as hell, instructions were great ruined one tho cuz I put it on all stupid lol, went to take it off and got dust on it so had to throw it away which was from my own stupidity. 2nd attempt was spot on cut outs are perfect no problems what so ever. Keep up the great work, from now on I will ONLY buy tech armor protectors. Very satisfied customer. Will buy again in the future
0.47408563	0.3805743	good quality and works on iPhone5 well , this is not ok I have to put more words ,to rate it please ignore this part
0.02923131	0.2970624	I couldn't comment on how effective the screen protector is because I couldn't put the damn thing on even in the 6th try. I wasted 12 bucks for a screen protector that doesn't stick without leaving annoying bubbles. Don't buy this thing.Customer service of Tech Armor sent me an e-mail and told me that they were gonna send me a new product for no charge. I will give a better feedback when I install them successfully(Hopefully) this time.It reduces the clarity of the screen, however it doesn't show finger prints and glare.
0.9716094000000001	0.83993745	I purchased this cover to replace the ones I ordered previously, which were already peeling off within one day. This set was easy to apply and had everything I needed to make sure that there are no bubbles and that it stays put.
0.9804116	0.7586343000000001	As with any screen protector this protector is hard to put on.  Once I was able to put it on I have had no problems.  This is a great screen protector.
0.40077925	0.6214516	I'm very particular about the screen protector for my phone. It needs to be totally bubble-free and clear.  I bought this, knowing it was matte, but hoping that any pixilation would be barely noticeable.  It pixelates the screen display terribly!  If you are like me and love the crystal clear display on the iphone 5s, you will NOT like what this screen protector does to the display.  I'll be trying a different screen protector.
0.9692648000000001	0.7553141	Easy to install compared to other brands I have used. Went on without issue. Protector fit to edges perfectly but did not center over speaker and camera lens. Otherwise, I am well pleased with the item quality.
0.8523081	0.70888567	I think this is generally a really good cover.  It's a little tricky to put on, and if there is ANYTHING on the screen, then it will leave a bubble.  It took me a few tries, but I've got it mostly on.  It's not peeling at all which is nice.
0.923466	0.74312544	Super sleek and barely noticeable! Very easy to smooth out bubbles so that it doesn't look like it's a screen protector.
0.7944876999999999	0.74453956	Item was easy to apply and does a very good job of preventing glare and fingerprints like it says in the description. It does decrease the screen resolution, but it gets better once you're used to it
0.9993601999999999	0.8764414	absolutely loved the tech armor screen protectors. I had previously bought one for my ipad with retina display and turned out well so i got one for my iphone 5. Very easy to put on. I would highly recommend this item.
0.8419607	0.7313869000000001	Easy to put on. No problem with Belkin Grip Candy Sheer phone case. I forget it is even there but know the phone is protected.
0.99979377	0.8594674999999999	This clear screen protector is easy to apply and fits perfectly. You can't beat this price. You can hardly tell it is on. Great product, quick delivery. Worth every cent.
0.08110291	0.35283038	I ordered this product when my Iphone 5 needed to be replaced.I thought I was reordering the same screen protector I had on my old phone.  WRONG.  This product has a MATTE finish.  If you want a crystal clear screen on your IPhone that appears totally INVISIBLE (you seriously cannot tell it's there), you need to order Tech Armor's &#34;HD Clear&#34; Screen protector, not this one.I didn't even bother returning this because the return shipping would have cost almost $6.  Hope this helps you.
0.99341524	0.8126808000000001	I've used a lot of screen covers in my day, and these are definitely the best! They go on well, they come with the little card that actually covers the width of the screen to apply the protector, and they last a long time! I'm not a fan of the matte kind, so these are great!
0.14307114	0.5166769	Let me start off by saying I NEVER EVER EVER write reviews.When I opened this product it unfortunately was not what I expected. The screen cover made it very hard to see anything on my phone even though the brightness was up all the way. This is not to say others will not like it, It just was not the screen protector for me...HOWEVER before I purchased the screen protector I saw that Tech Armor Company was very accommodating with returns. Because I was disappointed in the screen cover I decided to email Tech Armor and see if there is anything they could do. Within' 2 hours I got an email from Tech Armor saying that they would not only give me a new clear screen protector at NO cost to me, they also allowed me to not have to deal with the hassle of returning the one I originally bought. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised at the awesome customer service!Its comforting to know there are still nice companies out there :)
0.96218526	0.859316	This is exactly what I wanted. The cheapest one at best buy was still double what this one costs, and this one is pretty hight quality too. It feels good on my phone and doesn't get in the way and even helps against sun glare (at least better than my old case/cover did). The only thing I didn't like is if you follow the instructions they tell you to peel off a second covering on the front that this protector doesn't have. So I felt like an idiot picking at the corner of the plastic screen for 5 minutes.
0.9739888000000001	0.75121593	With a steady hand and keen eye, this is probably an excellent product.  I have neither and tried without success in getting a perfect application without a bubble.  Some bubbles just don't want to leave the screen.
0.018112003999999998	0.43106094	Tried two of them on the phone and finally went back to the store to have one put on professionally.  Was not able to get the bubbles out.
0.99827665	0.8378004000000001	Works exactly as expected. Glare is reduced and screen is protected. Spot-on sizing and accurate cut outs. All protectors are a pain to install but I highly recommend. Great value.
0.79119146	0.70048285	Glad they were inexpensive, because they didn't work for me left too many air bubbles. Takes away the beauty of the iPhone.
0.98963237	0.7226682	Got my screen protectors and they do what they say.  I am happy with the purchase and would recommend this product.
0.8765212	0.597651	Tech Armor Apple New iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3-Pack) [AT&T;, Verizon. Sprint, International and Unlocked iPhone 5 Models]Cheap not good
0.42800820000000006	0.58084345	This was REALLY hard to actually get on my phone in the right place and without any crap stuck underneath. It was good that it came as a 3-pack because I totally ruined the first one I tried to put on. Once I actually got one on my phone, though, it seems to work great.
0.6367085	0.6756536999999999	This product is very good for the price as it comes with three protectors. However, I had a problem with where the holes were cut for the front-facing camera and speaker. They're not really centered and kind of aligned to the left. It's not a big deal, but I tend to notice things like that. Otherwise, the screen protector is great!
0.7683804	0.7419668	The first screen protector I placed on my phone looked wonderful! No bubbles or lumps; looked like nothing was even there! I pulled out the 2nd screen protector to put on my boyfriend's iPhone 5 and was disappointed to find that it was bent in half! Luckily I had one more so I tried the last one. I got the whole thing on nicely without bubbles except for the corners. For whatever reason they would not stick! Luckily, Tech Armor has a lifetime warranty on their protectors so I contacted them with the issue. They apologized and immediately sent me a new pack! Super fast and super polite service. Would definitely recommend!
0.9742094000000001	0.8235056999999999	This screen cover for the iphone is great.  You can't even tell it is there.  The screen is still perfectly visible and clear with it on.  You won't be disappointed.  I am using it with a Photive Hybrid iPhone 5 Bumper Case and the combo of the two work perfectly.
0.99456155	0.80124253	This product is exactly what I wanted. Good quality and fast delivery. I have had it about one month now. I am not exactly careful with my iphone5 and this screen protector is still in tip top shape.
0.997592	0.78272116	Great screen protector! Easy to apply, it does not diminish touch sensitivity, easy to clean. Good price too. Love it!
0.9741143	0.76575077	These are the first screen protectors I've ordered, but they work great for me! Clear, semi-easy to put on, and a good price.
0.7600887	0.70730865	I recently ordered this product and did not realize that the cut outs for the ear speaker and front camera were off set due to senors unseen on the black iPhone 5. After using up some of my screens I sent a message to the company about my dissatisfaction. They then sent a diagram showing the proper fit along with some replacement screen covers for me to get it right. Great customer service. I would suggest that they tell buyers about the screen cut outs before hand, how they fit and why. Once I did put them on correctly they work very well. Much better than other brands I have tried in the past on other iPhones.
0.99801624	0.80885124	The screen protector came fast. It was came was very easy to apply, I got it on the first try. I was also pleased with how well it fit my phone. All around it was fast, easy and cheap. Great buy!
0.16256514	0.6136931	"**UPDATE**: I was contacted by customer service at Tech Armor, and was offered a replacement. Once it arrived, I was able to successfully install the replacements with relative ease, paying particular attention to ""side 1"" and ""side 2."" The screen protectors are very clear and thin - it's difficult to tell they're even on the phone. Despite the initial frustration, I am overall satisfied with the product.------------------I have used Tech Armor on all of my past devices, and have always found their products to be of the highest quality and the best in the industry. I recently purchased this product for several iPhone5's; The tabs indicating which side of the screen goes toward the device are very small and barely legible. I had a lot of difficulty installing the screens on my the phones, and they didn't look good - dust and bubbles were visible in all 3 applications (not what I had come to expect from Tech Armor's products). I ultimately discovered that 2 of them had been installed backwards, being that I was unaware that there were specific sides - not sure if this caused the bubbles. The third, however, which was installed correctly, had bubbles/air pockets, despite my attempts to remove them. I would recommend Tech Armor modify the instructions to make customers aware of this fact. I wound up throwing away the screen protectors and I am now without screen protectors for any of my phones. Really disappointed."
0.27635240000000005	0.51114684	nice, already have some scratches on it, but i guess that comes with throwing your phone in your purse all the time...
0.19477913	0.454496	The screen is crystal clear with this screen protector on, you can barley tell there's a screen protector there. Amazingly easy to put on, and I am the worst at putting them on! But it went on with no air bubbles or anything!
0.89881575	0.757342	Because of this product, this was my first time ever in my life where I applied a screen protector and didn't have dust or lint underneath. It comes in a pack of three which is great. The cleaning cloth actually grabs dust.. other clothes just drop dust back onto the screen. Applied the screen protector and aligned easily, and it's like it's not even there. I was so proud of myself.. seriously. After you apply, the screen protector feels really rubbery on the surface, but if you give it like half an hour, it's so smooth and super clear. Great product!
0.9611957	0.77721214	easy to apply unlike some other screen protector..touch friendly non glare and matte finish goes well with the otter box defender series case.Use in combination with the 2 combines double protection for your screen.non sticky leaves no residie.prefer this over the &#34;leading brand&#34; which is 20.00
0.9672084999999999	0.7129951999999999	Easy to install and completely clear! They stand behind their product like no one else! Go ahead and buy it!
0.97199684	0.77973473	The hole for the home button is exactly the right size, so start at the bottom as the pull tab indicates to make sure it lines up right. My husband is getting the 5 for his birthday and I can use the leftover protector for his! Great product! VERY clear. I cannot tell it is on there.
0.98929405	0.82925	I can't tell the difference between all the screen protectors features (i.e. HD, UV protector, etc.). I just wanted something that protects my screen from the occassional scratch or moisture. I saw this brand was highly rated but the price was a little more than some of the other brands. It fits my iPhone 5, not perfectly, it's slightly off but it doesn't bother me. It's just as easy (or difficult) to apply as any other screen protector. I always manage to have some dust or bubble after I finish applying screen protectors, with no exception to this brand. I went with this brand because I read a few reviews that said the company had excellent customer service and either refunded or replaced any customers that were unsatisfied with their product.
0.8153883000000001	0.6781138000000001	These screen protectors look very grainy. I paid a lot less for screen protectors in the past for my iPhone4 and they were much better than this product.
0.6992918	0.5908829000000001	Put this on in all of three minutes.  No bubbles, looks awesome.  Not sure how long it will last but it was definitely worth 10 bucks.
0.99861276	0.8526384	Love this screen protector. Easier to clean ... even my toddler's fingerprints. Very glare proof and easy to put on.
0.9992125	0.8708003000000001	I got these for my iphone 5. If you follow the directions included on how to apply them, you should be able to do it without getting any bubbles underneath. I love that these go on easily and smoothly, and minimize fingerprints and glare. I will always buy this brand of screen protectors in the future.
0.9867357	0.81928426	The Matte finish is the best!!! I don't have to deal with the overhead lighting glaring off my screen!Most especially, this is thee best company to buy from - Why do I love this company? Because they're consistently good. Good product, Fulfilled by amazon (guaranteed to be there by whatever date without fail!), and honestly, because the package is complete. Included is however many screen protectors, a cloth to clean the screen, instructions, and a little scraper to get out any air bubbles. I LOVE these products. So much so that I am a repeat buyer. I got screens for my ipad mini, loved it. Bought protective screens for my iphone, my husband's galaxy 3S, and even bought some for my coworker's iPad. I even installed them on all four devices! Everything is self contained!
0.9906546999999999	0.81666553	Product as described. Easy to apply. No air bubbles at all. High quality screen to protect your iPhone 5 screen.
0.99533296	0.7747196	I have always bought a matte screen or anti-glare and decided for my husband's iphone 5 to buy this clear screen and I'm glad I did.  You can barely tell that there is a screen protector on the phone and the resolution is great.  If you do mess up, you have two more to use.  Overall great product and will buy again.
0.81425023	0.7429956	Protects my iPhone5 screen however due to the anti-glare/fingerprint feature it distorts the sharpness of the image. The screen protector is easy to apply as long as you take time in preparing the screen and do not rush through the process when applying the film. I had few air bubbles to deal with.
0.90511787	0.66409135	I like this screen protector a lot. The anti-glare works well and the instructions were helpful with one glaring exception. The instructions tell you to remove the second film from the protector after installing on the Iphone screen. There is supposed to be a tab to do this. So after examining all three of the protectors in the box I confirmed that none had a second tab. Not only did they not have a tab, there was no second film to remove. I can only assume the instructions are for the non anti-glare product. I am a big believer in following instructions and hate to be misled with incorrect ones.The instructions did tell how to get rid of trapped dust and they provided the tape to do it. That was most helpful. I am very happy with the installed product and RECOMMEND it. I removed the installed screen protector on the Otterbox I got for the phone as I thought it was too thick and installed this screenprotector instead. I think it's a definite improvement over just the Otterbox which is a great case.
0.17710122	0.38354284	Don't like it because leaves fingerprints very easily. I'm not so impressed with this but I guess for someone works by for me no.
0.98399067	0.5128689000000001	Customer service is awesome, they address issues the same day you write to them, I strongly recommend to watch the video tutorial to learn how to use this screen protector. Buy with confidence
0.92822003	0.8746524999999999	Most low ratings I read had a lot to do with the results of installation.  This 5-start review is strictly a reflection of my installation results.  I'll provide another review of how this performs over time.I read people calling this product a &#34;dust magnet&#34;... and since dust is the primary reason for &#34;bubbles&#34;... its understandable why those people were unhappy with it.  I think most/all protective film (and their adhesive quality to stick to the phone) will be a magnet.  So those kinds of comments really goes without saying.Regardless... I was able to install this on my wife's new iPhone 5S without any problem.  I think this is such a great product from what seems to be a reputable company.  The packaging and what's included is impressive... given it's one $7!  They give you everything you need to be successful in the installation - microfiber cloth, card, dust removal tape.  And they have a great website with video on how to install.  And I think the number of reviews and average rating of this product really reflects the true quality of the product.Anyway... I provide this review to give some tips in ensuring your installation goes well, too.So I'm not sure where people went wrong who are unhappy with their install results.  You do have to patient, steady hands, etc... all goes without saying with things of this nature.  But most of all, you just have follow their instructions and tips.For example... in their video, it suggestion doing the installation in the bathroom... where there's least amount of dust.  Running the hot shower to steam up the room helps to subdue any dust in the air.If you follow the instructions and tip... it's hard to miss.  The rest is just patience.Here's a tip I can give.  Once you've followed their tips and instruction... when you start to stick the film onto the phone... have the dust removal tape near by.  Now lay the film onto the phone... very slowly... starting on one edge of the phone.  It's difficult to ensure perfect alignment doing it this way, but bear with me.As you lay down the film and as it sticks to the phone, if there are any tiny dust particulars at all... it will bubble up immediately.  If that happens:1. STOP (and hold your position!).2. Backup (lift up) the film just slightly (just before the bubble appeared.  You should be able to see the dust particle (either on the film or on the phone).3. With one hand holding the film up... use the other hand to grab the tape and slide it between the phone and film with the sticky side of the tape facing where the dust particle is (on the phone or the film).  Dab the tape to get the dust.4. Proceed to lay the film again.5. Repeat Step 2 and 3 if you come across another dust particle.If at the end, you're a little bit misaligned, just lift up the film (all the back), readjust, and lay it down again.
0.98142934	0.74143505	Clear screen protector and fits the phone just perfect. Can't give a 5 star as all of these claim to be easy to install but end up throwing one away in trial and error. Best so far.
0.88718307	0.5885179	Tech Armor Apple New iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector is good. After I used it, I will never worr about damage to the screen.
0.9599329	0.74455076	Easy to install. Clear plastic fits your iPhone 5 pretty well, but not perfect. Getting the air bbbles out can be a pain.
0.6109406	0.50621235	If you dont know you think there isnt any screen protector.Very Clear.No problem until now, works very well
0.010550051999999999	0.36886317	I am skilled at putting screen protectors on. I watched the video etc. all three attempts failed a I wrote cust service over a week ago and have not had a response.
0.97244227	0.8258984	I really didn't want to comprise the feel of the iPhone 5 screen BUT I did want to protect my screen from any possible mishaps!  I ordered this thinking if it didn't work out I wouldn't be out the $15+ dollars our local stores offer!  TO MY SURPRISE THIS HD CLEAR SCREEN IS AWESOME!! OMG you can't even feel that its on the screen!! It doesn't compromise the feel, look or add any bubbles, blurriness at all!  Its a super great value for the product and price! Must get!
0.9683782	0.8234372	I have used a number of different screen protectors, from very cheap to expensive. I really loved the Power Support protectors, but they are pricey. I have found that the quality varies significantly with the price.  I am very picky about the screen display and I thought I needed an overly expensive protector to avoid bubbles and haziness.This screen protector is fantastic. I thought I had botched the application and was going to give up on it and start with a new one, but with the included sticky sheet and a little patience, I ended up with a perfect application. It is difficult to tell that there is even a screen protector on the phone. Not only that, I have a phone case that provides protection around the front edges, and there is no lift or bubbles at the edges that sometimes happens with these types of cases. These are the only protectors I will buy in the future.
0.13042977	0.40032557	Impossible to apply without tons of air bubbles. If you can deal with that, then ok, but was too annoying for me.  I would probably give it zero stars if that was an option.
0.99490297	0.7706046999999999	Perfect!!!, fit is great and looks very nice. I don't like fingerprints on my screen so this product is just what I was looking for!!!
0.9865402	0.824095	Three screen protectors that were easy to apply. Would definitely recommend for the price. Comes with a small cloth and lint tape to get any pesky lingering lint off of your screen before you apply the protector. I just applied this so I will have to see how long one protector lasts.
0.5698991	0.6610425999999999	Followed the video instructions from tech armour site.  The included cloth did remove the fingerprint smudges but it also kept leaving lint particles so I kept having to blow it off.  Once clean, the screen went on smoothly and I was able to remove the bubbles with the included card.  But I had trouble removing the second tab.  It left glue smudges on the screen and caused some small bubbles on the bottom right corner.
0.85877097	0.7416328000000001	This is a clear screen protector that does not interfere with a phone case. If applied properly you cannot tell it is on the actual phone. For the price and lifetime warranty I say this is a must buy!
0.8967360999999999	0.7621477	These screen protectors work as well as, if not better than, the one that came with my Otter Box case.  Great price for a quality protector.
0.9483068000000001	0.655891	The product came on time and seems to work as advertised. Pleased so far. no complaints. you will likely not be dissapointed.
0.98638105	0.73118496	good product and was inexpensive. really wanted an antiglare screen and this one seemed to do the job. thank you.
0.17546874	0.54834586	I had a hard time applying mine and ended up using all three during the process.  My last one was applied really well and lasted quite a few months.  It recently got a bubble right in the middle of it and I can't get it out, even when I press it to the edge, it still forms again.  I thought the price was fair for the three covers.  I am just disappointed I had to use them all before getting a good application and now I'll have to get more.
0.081269175	0.49967635	My wife paid 20 dollars for a single iPhone screen protector at a big box store, and not only was it a nightmare to put on, but it made the screen look like crap. This option was 1/4 the price and worth the risk. It's been about 8 months and it still looks great.
0.99434745	0.8205414000000001	This product was easy to apply by following the simple instructions on its packaging. I am satisfied with the quality of this product as an anti-glare and protective covering for my phone. It fit the size and shape of my i-Phone 5 exactly.
0.9983871	0.78980887	This screen protector is great!! It was very simple to place on my iPhone 5 and has a great matte touch. I would recommend this to anyone.
0.9958800999999999	0.83342034	I chose this after reading the reviews and was happy to find that it is as advertised - a great screen protector. The package comes with 3 protectors, a high-quality cloth for wiping the screen to remove dust and fingerprints, and a &#34;card&#34; for applying the protector, and of course, instructions. I had no trouble getting it on the first try, and it's done a great job protecting my new phone :)
0.9118210999999999	0.71352285	I used these screen protectors with my first iPhone and now with my second one.  They save the life of your phone on a daily basis.  I drop my phone all the time and, coupled with a phone case, they prevent cracked and scratched screens.  I will use them on every phone I ever have.
0.9882021000000001	0.7082013	Very nice customer service, as well.  I did apply one wrong [my fault} and I contacted the company and they replaced it for me free of charge..I will continue to use this product. Just, be sure and follow the directions and it will last for along time with no problems. It is well worth the money to protect your phone, you can't even tell it's on the phone. It is crystal clear. You won't be dissappointed.
0.3746845	0.45636818	After following the directions, I still got a few air bubbles and somehow a thread stuck underneath. Sometimes the touch screen lags because it can't register my finger, but overall, does what I want it to do, which is protect the screen from scratches and such. It's thicker than I thought it would be, but I think I'd prefer the Zagg Sheild screen protector to this one. I only got the cheap one because I'm not sure how long I will keep my phone when the iPhone 6 comes out.
0.99916184	0.84203213	I am very impressed with the quality of this screen protector. It fits the iPhone 5 perfectly and lets the screen shine through as if there's nothing there at all. No bubbles! Easy to install, simple instructions, great packaging, really just a flawless package.
0.66306156	0.6951050999999999	The screen protector makes the screen look a little fuzy but I mostly only notice this when I take a picture. However, when I look at the picture on my computer later it's crystal clear so no issues really.
0.9958091	0.76906323	Sticked on very easy w/o bubbles. No complaints at all and great for price. Has 3 in the package together with a little cloth
0.8551619	0.6256010999999999	I brought this product because I travel a lot with frequent airport stops. Can you say no privacy! This product obscure the contents of my screen from wondering eyes.
0.99392986	0.8129501	This product was simple and very easy to install.  No bubbles like other anti-glare screens.  I would definitely recommend it.
0.78774923	0.6937718	I bought these screen protector's for my husband's Iphone 5.  Unfortunately, he did not follow the implicit recommendation of the manufacturer to please watch the installation video before attempting to apply them.The package comes with 3 shields, and the first 2 wound up in the trash because he couldn't get the bubbles out.  He was considering just going to Best Buy with the 3rd one and have them install it for some ridiculous price when he decided to just glance at the video to see what they suggested.Amazing - they clearly explained what he needed to do (which is not rocket science, by the way) and the 3rd shield went on effortlessly and looks terrific.  Read the instructions, watch the video and you, too, should have no problem using this product.
0.9637806000000001	0.7063308	Just like the single sheet of non glare screen I paid 15 for and I received 3 films of excellent quality.
0.97720635	0.8209626	I am pretty much a screen protectoe snob. I have always felt strongly about always having a screen protector starting way back when I had a Blackberry. I need them to be easy to install in a dry mount environment and look and feel like the glass they are protecting. The Tech Armor meets that requirement.  For the price, they cannot be beat. Going into the Verizon store and seeing 1 protector for $20 is a pure violation. Tech Armor provides 3 for a third of that price which is respectful of me and my wallet.  It is worth it to keep the plastic on that the phone comes with to wait it out for these HD screen protectors to arrive!
0.35738093	0.49948645	I have this on my phone right now.  I think it definitely makes the screen look blurry.  I've always used matte screen protectors and they've never bothered me until now.  Also, it really interferes with my touch screen.  Like, it doesn't always register my touches and almost never captures my swipes, unless I press extra hard and go slowly.  It's super annoying.  A real shame because the plus about this is that it was SO easy to put on and line up, and I had absolutely no bubbles.  Now I'm just waiting for a different brand (MediaDevil) I've used previously to come in the mail.  It's also not as smooth as other matte protectors.  My finger doesn't glide across the glass with that velvety feeling.  Amazon was nice enough to give me a full refund without me having to send them back though, so a plus for that.  Personally, I definitely prefer the MediaDevil protectors.
0.96105105	0.72904766	Love it!!! Absolute must if you don't like glare and fingerprints.  Would never have another kind of screen protector on my phone!
0.9984851	0.80174685	Great product. Easy to put on your screen with no bubbles inside. The anti-glare really works well. Very pleased with my purchase.
0.034846544	0.6408391	The tabs that come off as you adhere the product are old and sticky instead of coming off clean. Quite disappointed had to use alcohol to remove..
0.9747461	0.76318616	I love that these are more of a matte than a gloss and that it's a pack of three! They went on easier that I could have dreamed of!
0.5286741	0.5453051999999999	Not easy to apply took all 3 protectors to kinda get it on right. There are still bubbles and dust under the screen
0.009086639	0.45339563	Worst product I've ever gotten off of Amazon.Does not match up to the speaker and camera on the iPhone 5 andsticker residue wouldn't come off.The screens also fall off of the phone and catch on things which tears them off the phone.
0.99959993	0.8852558	The product shipped very quickly and arrived in a perfect package versus some of the other vendors shipping.  I have purchased MANY screen protectors and this is by far the best quality for the price I have ever received.  The matte finish is in fact matte and no finger prints can be seen.  It is also VERY easy to install with no liquid sprays.  Definitely worth the buy.
0.030997485	0.43521345	You have to put our own adhesive on it just to get it to stick, also no matter what you do you have tons of air bubbles. Oh and it slides and does not a hear well it move around on the phone. I would never buy this again
0.4810447	0.7172644	"This screen protector is pretty nice. Finger prints do show up on it as it does hold onto the oil from your hands. It was a little difficult to apply because mine did not come with the little ""#2"" sticker that you peel off after it is on your phone as the instructions said. Overall it is pretty quality material. I doubt anything will leave scratches on it and the company will send you free replacements for just about anything. I would buy these again."
0.8830347	0.7786618000000001	Easy to apply. I've had issues with another product peeling off, but these protectors appear to stick on very well.
0.9660777	0.84147614	luckily this pack came with 3 screen protectors because I royally messed up the first application.  My boyfriend was quick to blame the cover but it was definitely my lack of instruction following and haste.  I watched the video on the Tech Armor site and while going slowly and constantly removing any falling dust while I was putting down the screen allowed me to have a perfect seal with no air bubbles.  The screen feels exactly like the iphone screen does and I feel much more secure knowing it is there.  There are no more finger prints than there were already on the iphone and it wipes off easily.  Most times I forget that the screen is on it which is awesome!
0.07858327	0.41822952	I ordered the matte screen protectors and received a case instead. I decided to keep the case because I liked it, but was very disappointed I didn't get my screen protectors in time for my new phone.
0.99464715	0.8232233	Best screen protector ever! It was so easy to put on! I've never put on a screen protector before and I did this one perfectly on my second try. I definitely recommend starting at the top of the phone, rather than the bottom - makes it a lot easier to line up.
0.981964	0.7883594	got the protector and its easy to apply onto the phone.  I've recommend to my co-worker which she will get it for herself this x-mas/
0.00910151	0.29058975	The openings in the screen protector do not match the openings (speaker and camera) on the phone. I would rather not have portions of the screen exposed. I returned it and bought something else.
0.94405365	0.7227806	The case is good and soft. It fits my IPhone 4 very well. Even though I really don't like the color, I still bought it because i wanted an soft case but most the good-looking cases are hard.
0.9936396000000001	0.6354749	Love this product!!! Would buy again if need to. Works great for what I bought it for. Four stars! Love Amazon.
0.98819816	0.8104397	Perfect, easy to install with included tape to remove dust from screen. They are barely noticeable and feel very similar to the iPhone screen.
0.17683372	0.49485922	I bought this brand, because of the rave reviews. This was a bad idea! I think mine must have came from a bad batch.  I applied 2 of the 3 protectors i received in this purchase, and on both installs the holes did not line up at all.  If i get the bottom to lign up, then the top cut out does not lign up.  Even though both sides and top and bottom of the protecter are perfectly ligned up around the edges, either one or the other cut outs will not line up.  I realized after the 2nd one that i installed, that my entire purchase was defective and came with bad cut outs.  The install was simple, and quite easy (but then again, ive done this many times before)  I would suggest going on ebay and spending .99 cents for protectors if your looking for poor alignment, because i did not get any use at all out of this $7 purchase, due to poor alignment of the cut outs.  I would have sent them back, but have already tried 2 of the 3 i received.  I threw the 3rd one in the trash, once i realized they were all defective.  Total waste of my time and money, and i would not recommend this product to anyone.  Sorry, just being honest.EDIT:  I GIVE 2 THUMBS UP TO ANY COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT, AND OFFERS OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, SUCH AS THIS COMPANY DOES.  THEY SENT ME ANOTHER PACKAGE, AND THESE PROTECTERS ARE PERFECT, AND THE CUTOUTS ARE FINE.  I MUST HAVE RECEIVED A BAD BATCH THE FIRST TIME, THESE ARE PERFECT.  THANKS TECH ARMOR FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND FOR ACTUALLY TAKING THE TIME TO READ ALL REVIEWS.  OUTSTANDING SERVICE, 2 THUMBS UP A+++IF I COULD CHANGE MY STARS ON THIS REVIEW I WOULD CHANGE IT TO A 5 STAR REVIEW.  OH WAIT, I CAN CHANGE IT, AND I JUST DID.  5 STAR SERVICE HERE, AND I WILL BE BACK FOR SOME IPHONE CASES.
0.99620473	0.82535356	I have used Tech Armor in the past and always was very pleased with my purchase. This past order I had some difficulty getting the protectors to not come up slightly at the top of my phone. All three were like this . Tech Armor offered to send replacements and I'm sure these will be fine like previous ones.Have to love a company that stands behind it's products.
0.98231745	0.8184898	I received my order quickly and I expected applying it might be difficute after reading reviews.  It actually was pretty easy to apply.  Some have mentioned that it doesn't cover the complete phone, but with my case on, it fits perfectly!
0.9829996999999999	0.7908997	Quality is just as if it was purchased at a cell phone provider store. Received the item on time and love it! No complaints.
0.9980475000000001	0.8085253000000001	This item was easy to use, sturdy and a perfect fit for my iPhone 5 and comes with 3 screen protectors! MUST BUY!
0.99761343	0.87738657	I've tried many brands of screen protectors and this was by far the easiest to install without air bubbles. Has a nice clear finish, can hardly tell it's there.
0.9549733	0.80460435	The product was easy to installed, very few bubbles.  It fits perfectly on my I phone.  It still shows finger prints, but I was moreconcern about protecting the phone. it came in on time and good condition.
0.8457171999999998	0.74086857	So much better then what my husband bought for his iPhone (the ZAGG Invisible shield). His was $20 and it was not clear, you could see these tiny little red, blue and green dots. And the installation was ridiculous! These went on much easier. The only complaint I have is that they fingerprint so easily. Next time I will look for smudge proof.
0.48946932	0.5110045999999999	I like this screen protector very much! It's really clear and easy to use! The drawback is that it is not anti-finger print. But it's ok with me.
0.9646103000000001	0.7974136	If you have ever used a screen cover, you know that the real difference is whether or not you can get all the bubbles out and the screen protector has a good seal. This protector worked on both levels, and came with a screen wiping cloth and cardboard piece to help you smooth out the bubbles. Product met with expectations- if you need a screen cover, this works well.
0.9897729	0.7882909	I like these screen covers. Easy to put on. Almost unnoticeable. Doesn't affect screen visibility or graphics. I also like that its a 3-pack. Nice product! I recommend it.
0.8210823	0.7455132	Screwed up my first screen since it took a while to figure out the different covers and the steps, but got the second one on without any issue. Not sure if it's my phone or the screen, but the edges of my phone aren't very sensitive to touch and I often need to hit it more than once to get it to respond. Overall very happy with this cover, easy to clean.
0.7488710999999999	0.8120294	I didn't bother steaming up the room to get dust out of the air. It was easy to pull all the dust off the front of the phone using the included dust tape. I got the screen protector aligned right on my second try (I'm glad they give you three!) and got rid of two remaining bubbles with the bubble pusher. I can read my phone's screen out in the sun now. :) It's not fingerprint proof, but fingerprints are definitely less noticeable on the matte finish than on clear finish screen protectors, or the phone screen itself. It does change the image slightly, but I'm ok with that.
0.9903784	0.7315146	I got this last week and it has been very good. No problems. Works as intended. also i received this order a day early than expected.
0.5657153	0.6096089	Good value for this product, though it's a little tricky to get it lined up just right. I followed the directions exactly and found that when I had a piece of dust trapped under the protector, it was worse to lift and try to remove the dust (it just stuck to the protector, and the more I tried removing it, the more of a mess I made on the protector). Not a product issue, just something to keep in mind as you apply the protector. Good thing they include three of them! :)
0.8611603999999999	0.7290375	I needed to write this review because by, some small miracle and Tech Armor, my iphone is still working and looking great. I was outside and put my phone on the hood of my husband's car (I know, stupid). He didn't see it and ended up driving from the driveway to the street to re-park the car. My phone ended up in the street, but I didn't realize this until about an hour later. When I located the phone, the Tech Armor was marked from landing on the road, but after I removed the screen protector, the screen of the phone was in perfect shape. I'm so grateful for Tech Armor. I will have to say - it takes me at least two times (and therefore two screen protectors) to get it on right. But that's ok - as long as it protects the phone.
0.99523777	0.87216413	This product comes exactly as advertised.  It was easy to apply using the included lint cloth and cardboard &#34;squeegee&#34;.  There is still a slight glare when looking at my iphone 5 screen, but nothing compared to the glare without it.  Also, it does a great job of eliminating finger print smudges on the screen, while still providing a clear protective layer.  Some screen protectors are so thick they distort the screen, not this one - it almost looks like I don't have anything on it at all.  I love it!
0.98723775	0.685513	Recommended by my physical therapist for my back and posture.  It is great for giving a little extra support for my back when driving, at work, watching tv, traveling.  Conveniently folds quite flat so fits easily in a carry-on bag or backpack.
0.8302985999999999	0.82601154	I've only had the Tech Armor iphone 5 HD clear screen protector on for about a week now but I've been happy with the product. I watched the video for tips on applying the protecting screen and it worked out very well. I was concerned about whether the clear screen would bubble because I also purchased a Ballistic brand case that seemed to provide a snug fit. This did create one small, barely noticeable barely noticeable bubble in the corner of the phone but otherwise no problems. I would definitely recommend this product to others. One thing Tech Armor could improve on is the openings that are cutout for the receiver and the camera - these are not perfectly aligned/centered but at least they aren't creating an obstruction.
0.99972254	0.9016914	I had long searched for a screen protector for my new Iphone 5, and then I luckily stumbled across this perfect one. The screen protector is hardly visible on my phone, and fits perfectly. I had gotten it on in only the first try, after watching the helpful tip video. The proccess was a piece of cake, and I even put it on my sisters! Coming with three protectors was a HUGE benefit. Im absolutely pleased and content with the outcome of this product.Additionally, for no air bubbles (something we all hate), I used the Squeegee as I laid down the screen protector to help elminated all air bubbles. Also, the air bubbles that did remain (small ones), I could easily and quickly push them out with the Sequeegee, which was great! The company provides helpful tips and videos, which I reccomend to watch before putting your screen protector on, for they are very informative and helpful!Overall, the prodcut was affordable, easily applied, looks and feels great, and well worth every dollar. I'm for sure buying from Tech Armor again.
0.9997109000000001	0.7975626	Amazing product, great quality, is durable and protects my phone, and looks sleek and nice. Exactly what I wanted, for a great price.
0.23789448	0.37573093	I picked this screen protector for its reviews and ratings, but I'm not impressed.  I had serious bubbling problems with it.
0.9845233	0.7871634	Applied this screen protector without problem. Very little if any fingerprints on the screen now which is a plus &#8211; Looks & feels great. Shipping has been reliable in my experience.
0.9926113999999999	0.8143616	Worth the price..very nice screen protector. No compromise of resloution also. As mentioned it is HD display. Very good purhcase
0.9036875	0.54302067	I bought the clear protector for my o iphone 5 about a month ago. So far I have no issues.
0.13611266	0.39183006	Not only does it protect your screen but it also eliminates the otterbox oil slick created by static. Grt them if you are debating.
0.9995944999999999	0.8802093000000001	This is a great screen protector. It is exactly as described. I had no issues putting it on the phone, i just had to make sure I followed the enclosed instructions. No bubbles- first time ever!  Provides exceptional clarity of image. I also had no issue wiping off prints; just use a clean soft cloth. I tried many other screen protectors in the past and this is by far the best one yet. Great job Tech Armor!
0.9988445	0.85571885	Great material and does the job, very few scratches compared to previously owned screen protector/ privacy screens, highly recommended purchase
0.48252702	0.56896013	This is my second time buying this screen protector. It come with only 3 but that is not a problem. I play a lot with my phone and using after 3 to 4 month it get sratch but many scratch that I have to change it once a while. This protector is what I was looking for. HD crystal clear, when you put it you dont even notice there is a protector! extremely clear!
0.94319695	0.83033526	It was really easy to install - got rid of the few bubbles pretty easily as well.You cannot make out there's a protective cover on at all, if you install it correctly, and the screen feels and looks perfectly fine too !!
0.04428056	0.43796068	Did not do the job for me - the screen protector is basically black - so it ruins the design of the iPhone.  It doesn't work well with sunglasses on - and it does not lign well the iPhone 5 shape.  The black screen attracts more attention than is called for.
0.78646815	0.7837826	It definitely protects the screen, even from deep scratches :) I already bought this twice and will buy again. BTW they last long too.
0.98738766	0.72334945	I purchased this for my iphone 5.  After some adjustment, I was able to apply this correctly.  It looks great and does the job it is intended to.  I am very satisfied!
0.9996046999999999	0.86251104	Great covers for iPhone! Easy to apply; comes with easy to follow instructions. Fits perfectly. Smudges from normal use easily wipe off screen.
0.90889657	0.7250066999999999	It truly is smudge and finger print proof! I have a little bit of marking after using the screen protector but not nearly what a regular protector would do. I love the matte instead of shiny, much easier to use outside!!
0.9992683000000001	0.87003434	Went on easily, works great! I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a fingerprint-proof screen protector for a phone.
0.7979455	0.5924728	Nice product, fits well. A short term case for us, but worth the price. We are waiting for Lifeproof cases to be designed and produced.
0.93673575	0.7915545	This screen saver is great value for the money and super easy to get it on so buttons aren't covered up, my only disappointment is it makes the screen look & feel grainy, still good value.
0.9874835999999999	0.77790296	I got my screen protector on perfect the first time. No bubbles or dust..you can't even tell it's there! By far the best screen protector I've used.
0.90763974	0.8228528	I like this screen protector.  I took one reviewer's advice and watched the video at Techarmor.com before I tried the installation, and that was helpful.  This is my first experience with installing any screen protector, and it wasn't bad.  First time was on my white iPhone5; getting it aligned was a little tricky, but I was able to reposition it to my satisfaction after a few tries.  Bubbles were easy to remove with the enclosed squeegee (although it is a little flimsy IMO - I may use a credit card next time if I need to). I used Tech Armor's tips on getting out lint successfully - basically taking one piece of Scotch brand tape and using it to lift the protector off the screen near the lint/dust, then using a second piece of Scotch tape to grab the piece of lint/dust off the underside of the screen protector, and then laying the protector back in place (see their website for more complete instructions).  Took a little patience, but worked fine.Second phone was my husband's black iPhone5, and that was easier ... probably because I'd just practiced on my phone, but it was also much easier to see the alignment of the screen protector against the black phone than it was against the white.Fingerprints do wipe off with a little effort; it does cut down the colors of the display a bit, but not enough to bother me.  It's cloudy here today, so I can't really test the anti-glare aspect with sunlight, but I susupect it will be fine.  Worth the money in my book.
0.99798906	0.81807125	I found this product super easy to apply and you cant even tell it is on the phone.  Great product that was received quickly and at a great price.
0.9894316999999999	0.86539865	The one thing that annoys me the most about working around a lot of people is having to type a text or email and see at least one person reading as I type.  Like seriously?!?!?  The Tech Armor privacy screen protector is exactly what I needed both protecting the screen on my iPhone 5 and providing privacy no matter what direction the peeper is located.I did notice the brighter the screen display is the easier to see through the protection but the screen still shows up blurry and unreadable.An absolutely perfect accessory for commuters, students or if you have annoying significant others LOL
0.13430938	0.43240609999999996	The screen protector is easily scratched. I changed mine 3x in 1 month. Bad quality. Need to send me a new one.
0.9995168	0.88101935	We bought this screen protector because my husband's phone had what looked like a smudge between the phone and the case we had purchased for it.  This antiglare screen took care of the problem.  Now it looks great!  We used all three screen protectors for our phones and all three of us are extremely pleased with them.  If you follow the included instructions exactly as recommended, you won't have any bubbles and it looks terrific! I would recommend this product to everyone.
0.9950486999999999	0.7670473000000001	I bought these for my I-phone 5, and even though my phone case has a built-in screen protector, these will come in handy for later use. I would highly recommend them.
0.9307791	0.7248916999999999	This has to be one of the best privacy screens out there. Literally no one can see me using my phone. A lot of people will ask me what I'm doing because they think my screen is black (and obviously that I'm special lol). This does not blurr the screen at all. The cut out for the camera and speaker is not perfect, but it is functional. If I ever need another privacy screen protector for any device in the future, I will be buying from this company.
0.9701767	0.81563234	Great pack of screen protectors at an awesome price. The protectors don't hinder the phone's touch response. I know I've had protectors in the past that make it difficult to use the phone as you have to press harder etc...making it frusterating any time you use your phone. VERY HAPPY with these! Would buy again and again!
0.6271595999999999	0.5585901	"Because of my carelessness, the first screen film I applied didn't fit correctly.  The second attempt yielded a fine result due to more care on my part.  I like the protector.  One reason is that it is a ""dry"" installation film -no wet stuff, long drying time, etc.  I bought the clear model.  I am pleased with result and I now have protection on the front of my iPhone 5.Buy this protector.  The company stands behind their products -and the packaging and directions are first class."
0.9310269	0.65526086	I ordered this product for my new Iphone 5I needed a protection screen for it.  It wasnot hard to install and seems to workingjust fine.  Worth buying and using
0.9377127000000001	0.7551456	Easy to install but watch the video about installation tips - it will save you time and frustration. Works well to protect my screen and is completely invisible.
0.9719503	0.8058132	I must say I have used a lot of screen protectors. Ones I bought, free ones that came with cases, and then this. In fact the day this came a free one came with the case I bought. I had just put it on when this arrived. The free one went on like exactly what I paid for it. Garbage! Bubbles, didn't quite fit perfect, you know that little tiny overlap on the edge where dirt gets under or it can lift.Ok so the Armor tech HD shows up, and for a brief minute I thought ah run with the free one just let it wear out why waste a good one. I AM SOOOO GLAD I CHANGED MY MIND! This thing is like night and day.  I had watched the video the day before for install but it laid down like a dream. Not a single bubble, fit perfect no edge gap at all. I swear to oreos this thing is like there is nothing on it at all but the clarity is so much better than the actual screen. I am  a graphic designer. I use a Nikon SLR camera and always shoot with an HD filter over my lens it not only gives better photos it protects the expensive lens from scratches. I would buy this screen protector again in a heartbeat. I won't have to cause it came with 3, shipped free, was here lightning fast two days, and has a lifetime warranty.So yes buy this one you won't be sorry. If someone gave it a bad review because of install, my guess is they tried without a quick read or watch of the video but it goes on easy and that little thing about tape makes total sense it has a sticky back that would be how to keep the sticky there if you want to remove particles before sticking it down.Hope this helps :-)
0.23670906	0.41039890000000007	Have applied one on two phones, one is still very secure and the other has lifted in one corner but may have been how it was applied and not the products error
0.9974826999999999	0.8372487	I got these for my iphone 5 and they are great, fit perfect, no fingerprints on my screen ever and i'm able to see great in bright light or anywhere.  I can not imagine NOT having these on my phone!
0.99441826	0.8052068	This item does exactly what it was said to do! There is absolutely no glare or annoying fingerprints. I'm so glad I got this for my iPhone! The item arrived with great directions and everything needed for a smooth application to my phone. You can't go wrong with this addition for your iPhone.
0.9813622	0.79537654	Great product! These fit perfectly! I've had one on my phone for a month or so and its not scratched or peeling at all.. Go ahead and buy it!
0.6176897	0.51516414	The matte-ness of the screen protector extracts from the retina display of the iPhone. I understand it cuts down on glare, fingerprints, etc. but it truly is unappealing and I'm definitely looking to replace the screen protector soon!
0.9854219000000001	0.83364516	Past iphone screen protectors seemed slightly difficult to apply. There would always be that one air bubble or piece of dust that gets stuck, and you just decide to live with it. When I applied this screen protector, it fit perfectly and applied perfectly. I can hardly tell that there is a screen protector on it. It also fits perfectly fine with the Casemate Tough Case.
0.51489305	0.45324185	There is not too much to say - other than it does the proper job of protectiong my iPhone's screen.
0.96720886	0.7507969	And I have 3 of them!!! Completely satisfied with the quality and performance of these screen savers for my iphone 5!
0.2281433	0.727359	This is hands-down the best screen protector on the market.  A snap to install, tough, sensitive to the touch. and inexpensive, too.  I've tried a lot of the others over the years.  Don't waste your time and money.  Just get Tech Armor.  You won't be disappointed.
0.97189724	0.73612106	Great quality at a great price! The screen feels just like the iPhone glass, and it has already protected it from a horrible drop.Delivery came in a speedy manner and no packaging problems.
0.9794565000000001	0.74445474	It's great it's more clear than others that I had. Easy to install and it doesn't show that you have one
0.8173071	0.60244983	I have friends who spent lots of money on screen protectors at the apple store and they were not satisfied. When I showed them mine I had to give up my other two screens hahaha
0.9758332000000001	0.79660785	Fits well on the iphone 5; its privacy feature is very good. I'll recommend it. Keeps the glare off. Received the item on time. Plus, a lot cheaper than the other Z-brand.
0.99415624	0.8444563	I have owned multiple screen protectors but this one has been the best so far. The protector was very easy to install, there was no bubbles when I finished the installation. On top of that, the customer service was EXCELLENT. I contacted customer service because I needed a replacement for my screen protectors, and they shipped another package right away. The screen protectors look and feel very good. Extremely clear, you won't even notice there is a screen protector on the phone.
0.9943141	0.8418969000000001	I love how there are never any smudges or fingerprints on the screen anymore. These screen protectors are also highly scratch resistant.
0.98318386	0.76748896	Very sleek and yet very protective case that allows you to not be nervous about getting scratches or having to clean finger prints of your phone
0.99684525	0.8652582000000001	This product is great. If you follow the instructions correctly, no bubbles remain on the screen.After installed, the sharpness is perfect. I recommend this product to everyone who wants to protect your precious phone without losing image quality.
0.7854321999999999	0.5417405	You have to learn how to install it, but its a very good product. I have bought twice and both are the same quality
0.9972615	0.8366792	Great fit and super easy to apply. I used &#34;surgical&#34; gloves to apply it just to ensure no prints or air bubbles. It worked like a charm. Only got one bubble and it is at the very edge of the phone, so my screen is perfectly clear. This is the first time I use this brand and the first time I have achieved such a great result. Very happy indeed!
0.83037156	0.74375767	Easy put on, does not interfere with the brightness and leaves no smudges. I would recommend to everyone! The only down part of this is that it is not perfectly aligned/ cut, this is more of an ocd thing but not a major issue still gets 5 stars
0.12847379	0.5539552	The privacy part of this proctector works well.  But it absoloutly kills the retina display that the iPhone 5 has.  I would only get this if i absoloutly had to have a privacy screen.  And if i did i would find one that didnt kill the retina display as much.  Not worth it.
0.99330455	0.8552704	I've used Skinomi Tech Skin and a ZAGG Invisible Shield on my iPhone 5, and neither of them looked as good as Tech Armor. When applied correctly, the screen is literally invisible. The key is being able to apply the screen correctly, which no one seems to be able to do.This video is a great method and helped me apply mine perfectly: [...]
0.9172381	0.82453537	This is a good product. It comes with a microfiber cloth and sticky paper to help you get all the lint and dust off the screen.  It also comes with three protectors so if you don't get it right on the first installation you have two more tries.The only thing I dont like about the protectors is the holes for the earpiece is cut offcenter so lining up the protector is a bit difficult.All in all I would recommend this product.  It is just as good as those ZAGG protectors that cost $20 at Best Buy and they are less than half the price.
0.9940635	0.8259901	The screen protectors arrived in perfect condition.  I had no problem putting them on.  Installation was a breeze!  I would buy more Tech Armor without any hesitation.
0.8819544	0.73143053	very easy to put on, great surface texture. Only took away one star because there are still some small bubbles at the very edge no matter what I do. It's not that noticeable but I'm picky.
0.9888164	0.699281	Great product for a great price!Fits good; easy install, although it took me one messed protector before I succeeded.
0.99369955	0.67697227	I like this screen protector it was easy to install.And the how to video was a great help easy to follow steps.
0.93391967	0.6856508000000001	Easy to install. It works well with my Poetic Atmosphere Case http://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Atmosphere-Generation-T-Mobile-Verizon/dp/B0093CDLM0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1353088420&sr;=8-1&keywords;=atmosphere+iphone+5+caseBut very minimal 1 or 2 tiny bubbles on the edges. Also, finger marks are visible. Need to clean sometimes.Sold by: Tech Armor - The delivery came before the delivery date!
0.94729584	0.72862446	The product is rock solid with a nice layer that doesn't take away from the phone's beautiful resolution. Be sure to get EVERYTHING off your screen as the other reviews say. An air duster helped me make my 3rd application a success.
0.9990018	0.8674728	Super easy to apply and great fit.  No bubbles or alignment issues at all. Was concerned about thickness, but the touch access is still awesome and it's keeping my screen looking like new! Well worth the money and I will be back to buy more Tech Armor for our other phones.
0.9980194	0.8616264000000001	After reading many reviews I'm glad I went with the Tech Armor HD Clear Screen Protector instead of the Matte screen protector. Very easy to put on phone. Screen shows no proof of it being on.....very clear. Awesome product and shipping was fast.
0.9932841	0.8339974	The screen protectors are very well made.  The associate at the Verizon store,that put it on our new phones,said that these screen savers are the best she has ever put on a phone!!
0.9907254000000001	0.6766715999999999	Bought this brand for my iPod.  Love it.  Decided to buy several packs for our iPhones & giving some to other family members.
0.91830397	0.6472008	I can't stand applying screen protectors because I suck at it, but this was by far the easiest screen protector to place on my iPhone properly.  Good work Tech Armor.
0.9294275	0.80433965	Would definitely recommend this product - it's only been a couple of weeks, but the anti-glare has been very nice... much easier to see in sunlight, and I'm not constantly rubbing it on my pant-leg to remove smudges & fingerprints! Easily affixed, but as with any screen protector, patience is a virtue! Great price and prompt shipping, too!
0.9379519000000001	0.80080366	I have bought different screen protectors for various phones in the past and have always ended up with a few bubbles, even if small. This product is the best I have used to date - the inclusion of the sticky tape to grab each little dust grain is the extra ingredient that makes this work so well. Even though I had my usual troubles lining it up correctly, and thus had to lift the protector off and replace, I could remove every last dust grain, and the result was perfection!
0.88591546	0.7501361	The screen protector was fine, but it also came with a lot of helpful tips and tricks to put it on the case as well. It came with tape and a micro cloth to remove dust and particles and a card to use to push out air bubbles as well as a step by step guide on how to put the screen protector on.
0.9928389999999999	0.8566632	I really like the look of these matte screen protectors.  They are thicker than ones I've used in the past, so were easier to install.  The link to the video really helped with the installation.  One of the screens came with a small scratch, and the company quickly sent a replacement.  These also do a nice job of hiding fingerprints.  I will stick with this company and type of screen protector in the future!
0.051117003	0.31403196	After waiting 10 days from day order was placed until I received them!!..I went online watched video on YouTube..Read all the directions that came with the screen protectors and I still could not get bubbles out after putting on several times they get ruined..I ended up throwing them all out..Bought through Amazon..Order# 111-6187761-0642628..Update...After contacting Tech Armor they sent new package of Screen Protectors and received within a couple of days! Awesome Customer Service they stand behind their product..
0.37116855	0.48834735	arrgh... this is fingerprints magnet, screen can get very oily from touching overtime, do me a favor please get product such as power support or other matte (soft feel) screen protector for your iphone
0.6467033	0.68004286	It's kind of hard to get real excited about screen protectors, but these work great.  The anti-glare works well without dulling the screen resolution too much, and the anti-fingerprint piece really works well.
0.08604169	0.5961335999999999	It is an OK screen protector and does seem to protect the screen well.  However, it gets smudged so easily!!!  It constantly looks greasy and smudgy...and I generally keep my hands very clean!  I will even wipe off my hands before using it and still have marks all over the cover.
0.060789585	0.55959153	it doesn't last long. i have scratches on it already. i only used it for 1 month, and i have to replace it
0.9070921999999999	0.7418595	No problem with install. Bubbles worked right out as directions said. No problem with peeling.  Great price for this product.
0.99600995	0.8855289000000001	I am really pleased with the quality of the Tech Armor screen protectors. The quality appears to be top notch. It is crystal clear and does not seem to affect the touch screen capability of the iphone. To be honest, you can't even tell there is a screen protector even there.What's especially nice about this screen protector is that they include 3 in the package along with a squeegee.... in case you mess up. Application of this protector is very easy; there are pull tabs that allow you to apply the cover and adjust it. I got it applied in the first try and I typically mess up these things.Overall, this is a great product at an even better price.
0.72314477	0.6079256	I've bought others before but I like this one because it's matte and not shiny like the others I've bought.
0.6042261	0.6957022	It's a good thing this came in a set of three... It took me that many tries to get the cover on my phone. That was more user error, however; once I figured it out the cover went on easily and smoothly.
0.9983536	0.7666738000000001	super fast delivery and i love how when you apply the screen protector-there are no bubbles. no drama like the others. i also have a screen protector  for the ipad mini-works great. no complaints.
0.9876053	0.7355100999999999	you can actually read your iphone screen in the bright sunshine. Matte is the way to go!had the old style clear screen, then a friend told me about these Matte screens.  pays to have good friends!
0.9795655999999999	0.8642155999999999	I have always been reluctant to pay the exorbitant prices that name-brand screen protectors typically charge and have bought cheaper ones (that cost a dollar or less) for previous phones.This time, I decided to try Tech Armor, and must say I am impressed. For one thing, it is reasonably priced -- 3 screen protectors for around 7 bucks, plus a lifetime warranty.  For another, I can actually see the difference in quality.  The cheap-o protector on my old iPhone 4 never quite stuck properly (small bubbles around the edges) and there was a subtle rainbow effect (like a thin film of oil). I got used to it, but every time I used the phone, I was aware of its presence.The Tech Armor protector stuck on without bubbles, especially around the edges of the front camera lens, and the clarity and vibrancy of the retina display comes through without any artifacts.  I can honestly say that the screen protector is practically invisible.  Except for the subtle tactile feel around the edges of the home button, it's like it isn't there at all.  Great product!
0.94363105	0.6927095	This Screen saver is a 100 times better than what i used to get. It does exactly what it is saying.
0.8848125	0.6397531999999999	i really like how it is matte and anti glare - it was fairly easy to put on but I still cant get the one corner to lay flat.....it did come with 3 protectors which I just thought it came with one...so that was a nice surprise!
0.9908844000000001	0.7716464	I was kind of nervous about installing this but it was super easy! I just watched the online video and it was on with the first try. Great value; great product.
0.5164006	0.68673766	I had more of a glossy finish on my android phone, so the matte finish took a little getting used to.I blew my first attempt, and had to waste that one, but got the second one on/w no bubbles!  So I do still have a spare.It fits the face of the phone fine.Recommendable.
0.9186017	0.6230293	The protector is easy to put on and there is no bubbles. But I haven't been able to tell the differences for the HD part.
0.99279886	0.7721769	Value for money, It was easy to use and looks great on the mobile, must buy if you have a Iphone
0.9932694999999999	0.79194003	Anti-fingerprint and matte finish of the screen protector is wonderful. Would recommend this product to everyone with an iPhone 5.
0.18124712	0.56519645	Each sheet has a tab you are to remove after applying the film to your phone.  Problem is, this tab is glued on too strongly to the film.  So instead of easily peeling off, you have to use your fingernail to remove which damages the film. I would not buy these again.
0.09763533	0.49273829999999996	This product performs for me as described.I did not follow the instructions exactly as provided in the included pamphlet.When I tried to position two inches of the screen to the bottom of the device and then gradually push it down while pulling back the protective film it was crooked every time.Ultimately what I did was to remove the protective film completely, position the screen over the device and lay it down flat.Then I squeegeed out the bubbles.This product works very well from four angles, as compared to the 3M privacy screens which only work from 2 angles.If someone is next to me and they look over they cannot see what is on the screen. It looks to them like the display is turned off.A side benefit: People also can't tell if you have actually received a call or not because of the privacy screen, so if you need to get out of an awkward conversation you can just pretend to receive a call.
0.23102707	0.4426303	Got the package today. Screen protector are good, but all the three i got does not have the second tab to peel after apply on the iPhone. I realized when i removed the tab and applied on my iPhone.Thought may be it was missing on one of them, checked other two in the package, all are like that.Now i have a messy screen protector on my iphone, removed it immediately.Product must be good, but i got the defective or incomplete item. Will contact the seller to see if they can send me the compleet screen protectors.Update:I got the replacement protectors and tried again on the phone. I have managed to put them on without any further scratched on the front, so i am happy.
0.9983921999999998	0.8031937	I used several different brands with iPhone 4 so have lots of experience with application process.  This brand was very easy to apply and it looks perfect (no bubbles or dust ) on my iPhone 5. Highly recommended.
0.98034406	0.790025	Great product. Covers went on very easily with none of the issues I've had in the past with other iphone covers.
0.98611724	0.65329736	I love this! And i love that i get more than one!!! I only wish this had one for the back side. Oh well. It was a great deal for me.
0.9789866	0.7838456	Great-great product. I actually receieved this purchase within 2 days! I used 2 films, one for my phone and another for my girlfriends. It took me 2 tries on my phone and 1 try on my GF's phone. Really easy application, just make sure you clean your phone thoroughly before application. A bit disappointed that the camera and speaker holes don't match up perfectly but at least they don't cover up either one so I shouldn't complain too much about the protectors. All in all it's a great product.
0.9924154000000001	0.8097726	Very easy to put on. Got it exactly right the first time! Fits perfectly! Package comes with 3 incase you screw up or need a new one. Also comes with cloth and card to help you put it on. I didnt need the card but the cloth was helpful to get the lint off.
0.10374123	0.5771189	Screen protector itself is off very good quality. however the openings from front camera and mic are much larger then the actual size of them.
0.9219799999999999	0.63339937	applied to 3 iphone in my household. 2 applied without any problems. 1 did have problems with air bubbles in the middle of the screen.
0.7686535	0.6265670999999999	I've ordered screen protectors in the past and haven't been able to put them on without getting bubbles underneath.  When that happens I'd tear them off and go to the mall and get it done.This pack came with 3 shields.  On the first try, the film went on, COMPLETELY bubble free and clear as day.  Like the title, I am shocked, AND pumped that I have 2 more that are unused.  3 shields for $10 bucks?  Yeah, one of the best deals on the internet.
0.9275469999999999	0.7488815999999999	This is so far the most satisfactory screen protector i have had. The only thing that (sometimes) bothers me is that the screen no longer has reflection, so I can't use it as a mirror anymore. Other than that, I love it!
0.99343324	0.85664123	The screen is well protected and the picture quality is clear. This product is inexpensive as well. The instructions are easily depicted.
0.7785218	0.7316436	Works with the 5s. A little difficult to place correctly . You get 3 in a pack. Only protects against scratches.
0.0872736	0.46588999999999997	It is little difficult to put on the phone.  First I got too many bubbles.  Second time it came out ok.
0.9433049000000001	0.7987032	I purchased this to replace a Zagg HD screen protector.  It is easy to put on, it is very clear right off the bat. No need to wait for any bubbles to clear in a couple of days since there are really no bubbles.  The only minor issues is that they don't make a protector that is case friendly.  It fits except for maybe in one or two small ares on the edges where the case ruffles the screen protector slightly.  If the screen protector was a bit shorter to the egress it would be perfect.  If you don't use a case then it is a perfect screen protector.
0.9569058000000001	0.6286936	thanks for the privacy screen its awesome!!! Now nobody can see what i am doing on my phone jus got to lower down my brightness and its good!
0.9958349	0.6926426	Great price and fast shipping. I am glad I went with the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint protector. Fits well and no issues. Thanks and God Bless!
0.9951045000000001	0.6471246999999999	Prompt delivery, excellent product and instructions: easy to install on the phone. Recommend you use the YouTuber video for best result.
0.6101667	0.57557946	I used all three of them, and still got a few bubbles. I followed the instructions, but couldn't work it out, so i read a few reviews in which they mentioned difficulty on putting the screen protector on too, and  also mentioned how grateful and amazed they were on your immediate response and quality customer service and got help right away.I'm actually disappointed with the product, but I've head you are the best option and would like you to make me believe that.Waiting anxiously for your response.
0.9845067	0.7925675	I had never tired the Tech Armor brand before. I bought the HD Clear out of recommendation from a friend and the tons of good product reviews.  I certainly would buy again and definitely would recommend to others. Very good product. Fairly easy to apply. The first piece applied nicely, bubble free on the first attempt. Take your time. But not too slow. Looks great. Very clear. Nice deal!
0.9668658000000001	0.7553065999999999	The armor is perfect, is not brilliant, so the fingertips really don't &#34;stay&#34;on the screen and is really strong to protect against scratches. Awesome.
0.62252635	0.56727284	I did not like the screen protector because it is not the exact same size of an iphone 5. So you can still see the edges of the screen after is intalled.Also if too thick compared to others that i have tried in mi iphone4 so you miss all the retina display improvement.On the good side, is one of the easiest ones to install.
0.98532224	0.7995575	I'm one of those people that hate to have my screen dirty or with scratches. But I'm also very picky on the  &#34;touch&#34; of the screen: I hate when my finger don't slide well, so at first I was a little reluctant on using this on my iphone 5 (I bought it for my wife, as she is not as picky).But after I've applied to her phone, I've decided to put on my own!It's very good! The screen is clear, I have no bubbles at all and the fingers slide as well as on the glass. Most times I don't even remember I have a screen protector on my phone.Highly recommended.
0.9679071	0.6493338000000001	This is the best screen protector on the market to date. Not one issue, it is what it says and I couldnt be happier.
0.88625634	0.7455789	In the beginning, I was a little hesitant about this product because after its installation, the sensation when touching the screen was a little different from the other films I had (all clear, none were matte); it also appeared to affect the brightness of the retina display (as some folks had brought up on their reviews). But I really like this screen protector, it seems to protect the screen pretty well and I kind of got used to how it feels now. I like the fact that it does not leave those annoying digital marks on the screen. I would recommend buying it (actually my husband is also using on his iPhone). He had more issues with bubbles than me but he didn&#8217;t seem too concern about it&#8230; we still have the third protector in case he decides to replace it (it come with three screens).
0.99608016	0.8554796999999998	I love that they are a matte finish and they really do cut back on glare. Your finger slides easier on the matte finish screen protectors than on the shinny ones. I recommend this product.
0.98128295	0.8253995999999999	Tech armor supplied me with three screens. At first i had difficulties to put on the 1st screen without creating any air bubbles, but with the tools they provided to apply the screen correctly was very helpful. Thank you tech armor!
0.8312370000000001	0.7765769	the package came decently quick, after taking them out of the package i realized that these protectors have 3 holes one for the camera one for the earpiece that actually doesnt extend past the brightness hole and the home button of course. they were cut to precision and it feels better to have a protector on rather than having it just as glass. plus if you like taking care of your electronics like me it is very worth purchasing. its pretty much like nothing is even there, it doesnt mess with the retina display at all and doesnt give off that rainbow effect that other competitors show/have. so pick up a box of these, if you mess up the first time there are 2 more to use. But shoot for the first to be the best placement because after all the abuse the screen protector will recieve from natural wear you will eventually have left overs to replace. i highly reccomend these!
0.55958104	0.45933586	It's like this screen protector isn't even there!!! Such a great screen and have nothing bad to say at all. I buy them for all my Apple products now and won't use any other brand.
0.9992546999999998	0.7709273	Tech Armor is fantastic.  Extremely durable and undetectable.  Protects the screen Perfectly and install steps are top notch.  Best value on the market by far!!!!
0.5296801999999999	0.6299784	Maintains the visual integrity of the original phone screen. Had a little trouble with installation... ended up having to use a credit card to apply it to remove the bubbles... otherwise, would buy again.
0.8254365	0.7510475999999999	I got the very next day. Nice product, easy install. But i found the non-glare effect a little too strong as is reduces the clarity of the screen a little too much.
0.06649834	0.46075532	As usual only 1 out of 3 went on correctly. You get what you pay for.With a 2 out of 3 failure rate, might as well buy the expensive Power Support brand.
0.9673393	0.7365304	a little thickness to the cover as to be expected, but holds true to its name and provides good security from every direction.
0.9983288	0.7734025999999999	The best, most authentic iPhone 5 screen protectors you can get. My friends always ask me where I got my screen protectors from. Easy to put on, and very protective.
0.9981697	0.79805475	The product is exactly as promised-- durable, fingerprint-proof screencovers which are a perfect fit for my iPhone 5. Inexpensive AND excellent quality. The product was shipped immediately-- service from seller was up to par.
0.9967459999999999	0.77799535	Shipped fast and easy to use.  I had no problems applying the screen protector to my phone.  Good product and the price was reasonable.
0.9257035	0.6594913	So easy to install.  No bubbles..Lets see how it holds up now..My other brand of screen protectors did not seem to last very long.
0.9937091999999998	0.85689753	Easy to apply without air pockets. Definitely cuts down the glare and the screen is still clear and easy to read.
0.99663055	0.6849236999999999	wanted to protect my son new iphone5 and is the best money I have ever spend, totally worth it and recommended
0.9988748	0.8450414	This cover is great. It is easy to install and protects the phone as described.  I would definitely buy it again. I recommend it!
0.9855518	0.8398123	The privacy screen is really great sometimes you can't tell if your phone is on or off. It really gives a cool sleek look to your phone. With this product there was only one thing i could complain about and that would be the coverage, you cant really see this in the picture but it doesn't cover your front camera area very well other than that great product highly recommend.
0.86320513	0.76749086	I love the anti-glare/fingerprint screen protectors. These weren't difficult to put on, either. Didn't bubble either- which is a feat in and of itself! Great product and when I run out, I will purchase these again.
0.9981916	0.82902676	Very easy to put on, looks great, and great value as you get 3 for the price. I say buy it! Totally protects your screen.
0.9058845	0.7087319000000001	I bought this screen protector about a month ago or so and I was extremely excited about it that is until I tried to install it on my phone. Well when i received them i immediately opened it read the instructions and headed to my room to try and install it as perfectly as possible. But no matter how hard i tried i failed miserably. On the first screen protector i miss aligned it and my camera and home buttons were off i tried removing it and doing it over but it was too late. So i tried the second one and right when i thought i had it perfectly i noticed air bubbles by the home button and no matter how hard i tried to squeeze them out i couldn't. I then finally gave up with that one and decided to use my last one. I aligned it as perfectly as i could squeezed all the air bubbles out and just when i thought i finally got it perfectly i look at the screen and noticed i had gotten a little bit of clothe on the middle of the screen and some dirt but since that was my last screen i decided to leave it on and contact tech armor to see what they would recommend. Once i contacted them within the next day they replied saying i would get a replacement in the mail that all they needed was my order number so i gave it to them and since that day i haven't gotten a reply nor my replacement and it's being well over two weeks since that happened. Hopefully someone reads this review and gives me some info about this on what to do. But other than that i really do like these screen protectors and would highly recommend them to someone who is looking for a screen protector, just make sure that you try and install it as perfectly as possible.
0.9406095	0.781699	The protectors look great on the phone.  The only issue I had was that I had to go through two of them to make it work.  There are little tiny numbers on which side of the screen protector to pull off first and they were so small I didnt notice them the first time...but once I did it was very easy and fit PERFECT!
0.9135704	0.6890099000000001	When I first purchased these screen protectors I was not happy with the out come, and Tech Armor was nice enough to send me a new one free of charge. The second time around it only took one try and its been working pretty well ever since.
0.9954607	0.7414003	I love this screen protector !! will absolutely buy again and again !! is better than the regular protectors i love the matte kind!
0.99002767	0.6806614000000001	ITS AMAZINGGGGGGGGGG ! LOVE EVERYTHING. I LOVE CATS TOO BUT I LOVE THIS MOREEE BECAUSE ITS SO CLEAR AND I CAN SEE MY CAT PICTURES BETTER. (: &#60;3
0.989715	0.84691244	I've tried many and this is definitely the easiest to apply (no hassle, no bubbles) and it looks fantastic! The fact that it's fingerprint proof makes your screen look that much better.
0.99635136	0.8500331	This screen protectors are amazing. The company is really great, the packaging is such good quality i kept it because it looks nice. I bought the screen protectors for the iPod touch 5gen and was really satisfied, and now this; same story. They come with three to make sure you have enough for errors and to change later on, a very nice cleaning cloth and a card to put them on straight. I could not be more satisfied. Not even going to mention the price; its really high quality, and very decently priced.Greatly recommend it, don't bother for anything else.
0.834391	0.76905787	Super fast shipping! Product fits iPhone 5, however the upper portion near the front facing camera still peels a little bit, i even used an xacto knife to make it fit better. Still, good product for the price.
0.07676762	0.48432708	Used all three, never could get the bubbles out - bought another brand which works fine - no more bubbles!
0.86974275	0.8187151	I had priced a screen protector elsewhere and it was going to cost about $25.00 and was permanent.  So I saw these and bought them.  The cover went on easily and I've had no problems.  Finger prints don't show up, if it gets a little something on it, it wipes right off.  Great product and great price.
0.07288754	0.43087200000000003	1. Hassle free installation.  It only took me about five minutes to cut the edges (I couldn't take out the case) and install it.2. Tech Armor doesn't retain smudges unlike Zagg.3. Tech armor is so much better than Zagg.  I paid $34 for the Zagg  invisible shield front and back for my iphone 5 thinking it would last forever like the screen protector I bought for my 3GS and 4GS. However, after five months, the Zagg bore scratches and some bubbles became visible. Zagg agreed to replace the damaged screen protector for free; I paid $3.99 for shipping of the replacement.  I spent almost an hour trying to install, to no avail.  It is so sticky, it ended up sticking on a piece of paper, thus rendering it useless.  Zagg agreed to provide a replacement again but I gave up.  You need an expert to help you install it.
0.7663281999999999	0.63784987	Overall good. The lines are a little annoying, needs a little getting used to. It sticks pretty well, except in the corners around the iPhone button, I am afraid it will start de-attaching and allow dust in, etc. Overall, good product for the price.
0.611538	0.77168214	I absolutely love the matte screen protectors. They effectively reduce the amount of glare and fingerprints as advertised, but the display does appear to be slightly altered as the description warns. Not a problem for me but others may find this annoying.
0.9578551	0.63087714	I was amazed of how fast they shipped their product to my house. At First installing was difficult, but after watching the video on their website i was able to install it like the pros. my screen has no bubbles and has no scratches on the Procter. Thank you tech amour.
0.9866476999999999	0.65923464	Tech Armor got the protectors to me fast.  They are crystal clear once applied and the guidelines are followed.  I will definitely use this company again for other products in the future.
0.4946331	0.35347036	I think it's okay; it does the trick but I don't believe it is anti-fingerprint.  Also, the whole lifetime guarantee thing is not explained anywhere.  What does that mean?  Do you get replacements?  What?
0.7848624	0.67709047	I would use this product again. I have had it on my iphone for a few months and still looks brand new .
0.83376944	0.54915875	The product is what I expected and works great on the iphone 5.  I didn't expect 3 but now I have extra.
0.9883174000000001	0.80495715	Best screen cover I have ever worked with. Easy to install without streaks and bubbles. You wouldn't know there was a screen cover on the phone it is so clear.
0.6775445	0.65357316	NOTE UPDATE BELOW....I've used Tech Armor protectors on many devices over the years, but this one did not live up to the quality of other screen protectors they've sold me.  First, there were FAR more bubbles than usual, and despite all my efforts, they simply won't go away.  It's a day after I put the protector on and they're still there.  I expect some bubbling with this kind of protector, but most of the bubbles are usually gone by now.The other problem is that this screen protector feels very sticky compared to others I've used.  In some cases, I've noticed that when I rub the protector to try to get rid of bubbles, a sticky layer builds up on the screen.  It's like they put the sticky stuff on both sides of the protector, something I've never seen before.It's too much of a hassle to return such an inexpensive item, but I now know not to buy from Tech Armor in the future.UPDATE: Tech Armor saw my review and has sent me a replacement product.  I haven't put it on yet, but I'm impressed by their customer service and willingness to offer to honor their warranty without me having to ask, which I really didn't think was necessary. The product might not be perfect, but I have to give the seller credit for standing behind their product, something you don't always see.
0.9967790999999999	0.82331264	Great screen protector. It was very simple to put on. One trick I read and used years ago was putting it on in the bathroom after you have put the shower on hot to make bathroom with a little steam. It cause there to be little to no lint in the air. No bubbles at all. Love it.
0.9943539	0.84097385	I purchased this for my new I-Phone 5 screen cover. It is hands down the best and easiest screen cover that I have ever put on. NO BUBBLES!! =)
0.9971039	0.7756609999999999	Reasonably priced and you get three screens.  Good fit and easy to install.  Arrived quickly and with a follow up email from the company. It would appear they really care about their product.  Definitely recommended.
0.972474	0.6652264	great customer service! does its job. recommend this product. if you have a 5 this will save the your phone.
0.49373543	0.5230847	There hard to put on messed the first one , i got them for ipad to, use screen covers on every thing..
0.28408468	0.45171678	The screen protector worked well on my iPhone but imperfections in the plastic caused me to remove it. I bought a cheaper screen protector which was clearer. The cheaper protector does not adhere as well as the tech armor protector and does not give the same level of protection. I will most likely buy another tech armor screen protector and hope it is clearer.
0.9773793	0.76510704	This is my first iphone protector purchase and I have to say it was very easy to apply and fit absolutely perfect.  It does give a matte finish as described which is fine with me.  No finger prints and no sun glare now.  I really bought it in case I drop the phone and the glass shatters.  If this happens, at least the glass will stay in tact due to the protector film but I do like the other benefits.  I do like this product a lot so far.
0.40019378	0.4517771	There's absolutely nothing wrong with this except that you lose the oleophobic feature of the iPhone's native screen.  Is there an oleophobic screen protector out there?
0.9720888000000001	0.69203734	Great item and a must for the iPhone 5. So clear forget it's on.  No distortion at all when on phone.
0.02770245	0.48835492	Not worth the premium price.  No better than the one that comes with the phone.  Save your money and frustration. Not possible to apply without bubbles.
0.12157911	0.51079047	Tech Armor Apple iPhone 5/5c/5s Anti-Glare/Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen..., This is the item description, but I received the 3 pack for the iphone 5 ONLY. Checked inside package to make certain and it is only for iphone 5.
0.45606995	0.5696406999999999	I had a matte screen protector(Splash Masque) on my phone for 10 months, finally I got tired of the screen looking like there was oil on it (typical Matte/Anti-Fingerprint behavior) all the time and I opted for a clear screen protector... I should've read the recent reviews because not even three days into the product being on I have 3 scratches and one of them is all the way through the protector because there's air under the cut. Keep in mind I had maybe 1 scratch on my previous protector and they were both put into the same conditions. I didn't have any problems putting it on and it looked perfect once it was on, but I need something that won't scratch at the very mention of being put into my pocket.As soon as I use up the other two in the package this is going on>ZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Apple iPhone 5 - Case Friendly Screen
0.0018582344	0.31785873	Quite possibly the worst $6 I have ever spent.I followed the directions EXACTLY and could not get 1 of the 3 screen protectors provided to apply without bubbles. Literally IMPOSSIBLE to apply this product without it looking terrible.
0.7265534	0.70738745	"I bought these protectors about half a year ago. I was impressed enough with them for it to be a worthwhile purchase. Fingerprints easily rub off, and sun glare is slightly reduced. The slick matte finish made it easier to scroll.But what made me write this review was the latter part of the title. A few weeks ago, the last of my protectors was overdue. I thought ""hey might as well shoot them an email and see if they'll send me more"". They emailed me back about 12 hours later saying that they'll ship me more. They arrived in the mail today, 4 days later.I am impressed with tech armor's unconditional lifetime warranty. Somee companies will try to fudge there way out of honoring a warranty.  Some, like tech amror, mean what they offer."
0.7283609000000001	0.5545051999999999	I always buy anti-glare/fingerprint screen protectors because I like the matte look and feel, which is fine on this one. However, it distorts the screen pixels and makes everything I'm looking at look fuzzy. I haven't had an issue with this with other matte protectors so I will have to get a new brand next time.
0.5918749	0.55466706	I totally recommend this screen protector 100% it feels premium, it does what it claims! but if you are going to use this with another case for example la life-proof case make sure you get a aluminum home bottom so the home bottom is raised and its easier to click it when the case is on!
0.9515475	0.745835	I agree with the other reviews, in as much as it's very easy to put on flawlessly. I've done many screen protector installs and this is by far the easiest. I don't agree with the look though, I like it, but it does change the feel and the quality of the screen resolution. It's minimal, and that's why I gave it 5stars still, I'd rather have my screen protected.
0.034570067999999995	0.41128224	Every time I would try and put it on it would get a lot of bubbles and then get scrunched up. Very disappointed.
0.04359874	0.51003236	This product, although the price was good, and i got 3 clear screen covers, the first one was wasted in my just trying to put it on.  There were no instructions, although the paperwork inside the package said there should be.  Not worth buying again.
0.98738027	0.7423445	very easy to installi love the no glarebest deal with getting three in the package and it comes with eveything you need to install it.
0.9993141	0.8627855999999999	These screen protectors are great. They came in a package with instructions, a dust cloth and 'squeegee' to get rid of air bubbles. Great antiglare, easy application, fast shipping. I ordered some antiglare protectors from another vendor before these and the screen protectors were just thrown in an envelope. Thank you Tech Armor for a great product, fast shipping  and professional packaging!
0.9904497999999999	0.8380373999999999	Perfect fit and no bubbles. I spent much more for a single screen protector that was not nearly as good. Excellent price, value and quality.
0.6066176999999999	0.73368764	This took the beautiful, sharp image of the phone and made it hard to see.  The anti-glare seemed to pixelate the display.  I removed the protector and felt so much happier with my phone.
0.95181566	0.8019799	This is a nice cover and was easy to apply with 2 layers that are removed on application. Small gripe - the hole for the ear speaker on the front is not centered over the speaker, even though the cover is on perfectly striaght
0.83038116	0.62987405	I purchased this item and put it on my new and first iphone. It was not that difficult to install and did not show any signs of wear. I was happy with it from the start but I felt like I needed a lot more protection for my investment so I purchased an Otterbox which definately protected it but the screen protector on it stuck to and marked up the one on my phone so I removed it. After using the Otterbox for a short time I decided that I did not like how bulky my phone was and how difficult it was to get it in and out of my pocket so I purchased another slimmer case and bought some other screen protectors that were easier to install but they scratched real bad in just a couple of days. I ordered more of these and am waiting on them now and am also getting the Tech Armor case. You can tell immediately that this is a way better product right away. I highly recommend this item and will update this reveiw after I receive the new ones that are anti glare and use it for awhile.
0.89477533	0.774644	It's been on for two weeks, clarity appears excellent, easy to clean - I use the micro cloth that came with my Panasonic plasma TV. Installation is another story - good that it comes in a three pack - the first screen is a learning experience, the second is overconfidence and the third worked perfectly.  I'm pretty sure if I installed another now I would have less trouble.  One tip, waste one screen and use the sticky side to remove any dust, it works better than any of the other suggested methods.
0.71318233	0.46310115	Satisfied with the product. Make sure you clean the phone correctly before you apply the product. Take your time, do not rush!
0.9907404000000001	0.8501774	I get absolutely no glare and absolutely no finger prints. It's very smooth and shine-free, and the screen images/colors still pop. No concern with dulling the color.
0.25219065	0.34174990000000005	only 3 screen protectors for the frontand there is not screen protector for the back of the phone. which is quite necessary for iphone 5. if I knew it's like this I wouldn't buy it!
0.9995098	0.73952425	Great price--in between cheapo brands and high priced name brands; same quality as high-priced name brands.  Highly recommend.  3 pack; includes instructions, applicator, and screen-cleaning cloth.
0.99902034	0.8861789000000001	Item was exactly as described- matte finish hides fingerprints. It was very easy to apply- the instructions were very clear.  I'm very pleased.
0.9989446	0.84090126	This has worked very well....I like the matte finish..I would recommend this.It was easy to apply to the phone and it stays in place.  So far very satisfied.
0.9922099	0.82202566	I followed the directions on the video...altho mine had one tab and not two, I cleaned the glass as instructed, placing the film was easy and removing any bubbles was also easy. I cannot tell, by touch, any difference between the glass alone and with the film on the glass. I don't even see fingerprints and the glare resistance is a plus when I am in the car. I actually thought I would go thru one or two of the films before getting it right. It applied easily on my first try. I do think watching the application video is important. I am really pleased with this product and would not hesitate to encourage everyone to try this.
0.8475256999999999	0.70002323	I wasn't entirely sure I would like the anti-glare screen, but took the risk.  I liked that this product came with multiple screens, since I can't stand for the screen protector to have anything under it or to be off at all, and I usually can't attain the perfection I want with one chance.  Once I got the protector on correctly, I loved it! I really like the feel of the anti-glare, and like other users said, you don't really lose the quality of the screen.  I think it is great, and certainly nice to not have oil from my face on my screen all the time.
0.9605695	0.7838669	I purchased these after ruining the screen protectors that came with my iphone case during the attempted installation.  I was worried that I would have a hard time getting this on my phone or that I would get fuzz on them when trying to stick them to my iphone, but there was no need to worry.The cloth that came with them to clean off the iphone before installing the protector did not create fuzz and did a great job of cleaning my iphone.  The protector was easily applied and even though I got it on crooked the first time, it was a simple process to lift it up and reapply it.  THere were a few air bubbles, but they were easily squeezed out with the supplied squeegy.  Definitely recommend this screen protectors.
0.7664837	0.66973746	This product protects screen and does not seem to slip out of place.  I had some trouble getting the air bubbles out.
0.6764220000000001	0.7256403	This shipped quickly, I ordered it the night I got my new iPhone 5, and it came within a couple of days.I didn't read the directions carefully and totally messed up the first one, on to #2.The second one ended up having an annoying dust particle and a bubble, so I decided maybe 3rd time would be the charm.3rd one went on okay, however the bottom left corner was a little off and caused a bubble against the side of my case.This eventually became so annoying, (and started to damage the silicone edge on my case) so I ordered another 3 protectors.It took me 2 protectors to get it perfect. I am overall happy with this product. It works great if you can get it on and working to your satisfaction. I love the anti-glare. I am able to use it without being blinded in the sunlight.I would recommend this product to someone who has a lot of patience and a steady hand!
0.9427308000000001	0.7994313	These screen covers come in a pack of 3 and are a very good deal for the low price. The only thing I don't necessarily love is that it gets dirty pretty fast, more so than the screen does without a cover. But it did protect my phone- the cover got a few scratches on it, but my phone was clear. I would recommend this product, and I will buy again.
0.9966171999999999	0.8901929	The quality is top notch.- Cutouts were perfectly placed- Matte finish has a great feel- Keeps glare and fingerprints away
0.20080253	0.22554892	I have not used this yet since I bought it as back up in case I needed it to use with my otter box cover. Didn't need it
0.92389095	0.7700918000000001	After this experience, I'd never want another screen protector that wasn't anti-glare / anti-fingerprint. I found the product easy to apply, as well --- got it applied right the first time, no problems at all.Keep in mind we are talking &#34;anti-glare&#34; and &#34;anti-fingerprint&#34; --- not &#34;glare-proof&#34; or &#34;fingerprint-proof.&#34; Yes, this screen protector reduces glare, but doesn't eliminate it entirely. Same with the fingerprints. I have had the item a little over a month and wipe it down with a spray of Windex on a paper towel maybe once a week or every 10 days. Sure beats having to rub the front of the I-phone against my pant legs or sweater every other minute, LOL.I would definitely recommend the Tech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protector as a quality product that does what it says it will do.
0.99316096	0.83236915	These protectors are fantastic....once you get it on your phone. My first attempt ruined the protector, it wouldn't adhere to the phone without a ton of bubbles and streaks. The second one went on perfect without any trouble and looks great. It is glossy and perfectly smooth. I can't even tell it is there. It's a good thing these come as a 3 pack, as you will probably ruin the first 1 or 2. But once you get one on it is great!It also comes with a sticky tape to help remove dust, which is a huge bonus as it is near impossible to get them perfect without it.
0.25613582	0.5598214	Excellent screen cover. As long as you use the squeegee correctly when applying there should be absolutely no bubbles. Furthermore, the feel of the screen protector itself is incredibly smooth and natural. Unlike most screen protectors (at least older ones), it doesn't feel rubbery or sticky, but it feels closer to the original screen itself. Looking at my iPhone 5, it really does not seem like it has a protector (w/ the exception of the holes which reveal the camera, the home button, and the receiver I believe).My only comment for users would be to be very careful when applying the protector. If a piece of dust gets on the screen even after cleaning it, you're going to have to live with it (unless you want to apply a new protector).Also, when taking it out of it's package, I made the incredibly stupid mistake of thinking that the outer plastic was the protector itself. I didn't realize the screen protector was sandwiched between two outer plastic pieces. Unfortunately, I threw away the actual protector, which was a waste, and had the outer plastic (which looked terrible btw) on for a good 2 hours before I realized my mistake observing the other protectors. So make sure you take a look at the tabs, they both should be numbered. Peel off #1 first, and apply it to your phone, then peel off #2.Overall, good product. Would recommend it.--- EDIT ---Just went to the website. Even if dust gets into it, there is a way you can clean it! MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT THE WEBSITE. It's very helpful. 5 stars
0.54385376	0.5657127	These are great, definitely keeps my screen from scratches. Be sure to read the directions before attempting to put the screen protecter on. I wasted one by not doing so.
0.32844126	0.54168457	I've had the screen protector on for about a week and I am dissatisfied. First of all the size is a bit too small leaving the edges of the screen on all sides in protected. Secondly despite saying smudge proof, there has been a sticky smudge that just won't come off of the protected part of the screen. I've tried cleaning it with every imaginable cleanser without success.
0.10524917	0.32130596	The product seemed to be stable, but I failed at putting it on all 3 times :( oh well not the manufacturers fault.
0.8544370000000001	0.6660267	The product arrived earlier than expected.  Works just as advertised.  It takes a little work to get the bubbles out, but it should be easier with each application.
0.92084473	0.82915473	No complaints, basic product that works as advertised.  The anti-glare feature works as expected and i did not get any bubbles or imperfections during installation.
0.9937556999999999	0.8206024	Quite happy with my new tech armor. Easy to put on but I have a dusty house and it was also hard to keep dust particles off before putting the protective cover on. Of course that goes for any such product. Anyway I am quite happy with it so far, and combined with a thin hard case it's exactly what I was hoping to achieve. Very happy. Only took one try to put on properly, I know some people needed multiple attempts but it wa quite easy for me.
0.99890035	0.8179890000000001	Easy application, great feel, high quality...buy it.  Well worth the money, I have purchased several and these are the finest.
0.6140015999999999	0.7334025	The privacy part of this screen works very well.  The only problem with this screen is that the top glossy layer has rubbed off just from being in my pocket with nothing else in it.
0.99826777	0.85508585	I purchased this screen protector with some hesitance about the privacy function but after using it for 4 months I can say that it is amazing. The screen protector itself is amazing, thick and durable (almost feels like a second screen). It does add a bit of bulk to your product but it really doesn't (shouldn't) affect anything.The support is also outstanding. I have had this screen protector replaced 2 times (because of my heavy use) and it always arrives on time and in great condition. I am seriously impressed.The privacy function of this screen protector is great and works as advertised. Note: that if you have your brightness up all the way and are in a dark room, the privacy feature really won't work.Pros:+Great Design & Build Quality+Privacy Feature Works Great+Amazing SupportCons:-None-Would I recommend: Absolutely
0.9975514999999999	0.87474155	Buy these!These screen protectors are beyond easy to install. I really can't imagine anyone having trouble with these when they claim others they have purchased were fine. These don't cling immediately to the screen so reworking them until they're perfect is a snap.I have had a zagg s/p on this phone prior and it felt like my finger was getting stuck sliding along the phone. These are like glass. For the price you really can't go wrong, even if you do mess up 1 you still have 2 left.Customer service is just plain awesome. I emailed Saturday evening got a response Sunday morning. I can't remember a time any company has ever been so on top of customer service. If you've stuck out this review so far I highly, highly recommend these screen protectors, I am 100% a TA customer for life.
0.74972665	0.78195107	Coming from someone who tried a Zagg cover on my iPhone 4 and angrily threw it away, I love this for my iPhone 5! I was hesitant to try again on the idea of screen protectors after my failed attempt on my last phone, but I gave this a shot due to the reviews of this being a clean install with no liquids. It really was super easy. I didn't even go to the website for the extra help. It was so simple. Peel off one tab to get the sticky part down, push out any air bubbles, and pull off final tab covering. I have zero air bubbles.This thing would be completely invisible if it wasn't for the holes for the camera and ear speaker being cut awkwardly longer on the left side. I don't really see a reason why it was done this way. There is a centimeter longer gap on the left side (yes, the screen is centered on my phone). It's only annoying because the screen cover seems perfect in every other way.I do love this though! So happy I bought it.
0.8193056999999999	0.43681225	It was fairly easy to install although I did install it a little more to one side than I would have liked.  I haven't had an opportunity to see if it good at protecting the screen so I can't speak to that yet.It does make it a little harder to press the screen for typing - the screen appears to be less responsive.  Maybe that is just how the iPhone 5 is anyway, but I wouldn't think so.
0.9789146000000001	0.8400521999999999	These screen protectors are a perfect fit for the phone, nearly invisible once on, and are of the highest quality. Tech Armor by far has the best customer service; they are quick to reply, sincere, and hold up to the warranty even if you need a replacement due to personal error. I will always buy from this company no matter what device I own; Tech Armor is the way to go.
0.9587128	0.6694486	really great product I saw some similar items sold at the mall for like 30 bucks this package comes with 3 so if for some reason you do accidentally damage it you can just replace it
0.3006752	0.6079121	"the screen protector wasn't too hard to put on. I would suggest however that you use a credit card along with the polishing cloth to smooth out the air bubbles because the included card is flimsy. I've had the screen cover on my phone for about 2.5 months now. I installed it properly when I originally got it, but now there is an air bubble that has formed at the bottom of the screen and around the ""home"" button. The cover is starting to peel off from the bottom."
0.9843128000000001	0.75009656	It took a try or two, but this is for my first smartphone.  It works and feels great.  Would definitely recommend and use this company again.
0.06372201400000001	0.45090872	Got this for an iphone 5c.  The first 2 I took out of the package had dust cling to them right as the protective film layer was removed for application to the screen's surface.  Using the last of the 3 in the packet I got it on fairly dust free.  Within hours of being on the phone in a pocket with no keys or anything else the face of the protector was already scratched so badly it made us think the phone's screen had been cracked.  The screen was ok, but the protector is not usable any more as the scratch on it makes reading the screen underneath impossible. I don't know which protector on the market is better.  I have used a heavy duty otterbox for our other iphone that had a built in cover. For this phone we didn't want something as bulky, that's why we tried this. But I would not suggest using this one unless you only care about the screen being protected and not about how durable the screen protector itself is.
0.9679357	0.8449905999999999	I'm a fairly tough critic when it comes to products.  I've tried many many of these screen protectors and none have came close to the quality of Tech Armor.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  You can't even tell that they're on if you apply them correctly.  Be sure to clean and dust off your phone completely.  I used a lint roller to make sure that no dust was on the screen.  Make sure you have no fans blowing as it will just stir up dust.  Keep in mind that if you have your HVAC running it will blow dust around.
0.9986434000000001	0.84780824	This is my first screen protector for a phone, and I must say I was very leery about installing it properly, since such precision seems to be required.  I was very happy to find that the instructions provided by Tech Armor were fantastic, and made it relatively easy to install.  I got it right the first time, with no bubbles, and perfect alignment!  And even if you mess up the first time, they include 2 extra protectors so you can try again.  I am very satisfied!
0.68862283	0.7826361	This is a great product. I purchased it because I got sick of always having to clean the smudges off my screen. The matte finish really reduced the friction between my finger and my screen.  You will still have some fingerprints, but a lot less often. The anti-glare also works well, but that was never a big issue for me.One thing to note is that the matte-finish does effect the screen brightness and resolution. It's not that big of an issue, but the screen is definitely not as crisp.Also, when you install it, it seems like the holes are not accurately cut, but they are. The holes are for the light sensors in the camera. Smart design that doesn't effect the picture quality.
0.9787329	0.8454229999999999	Just put this on the new Iphone 5 I got for Christmas. Like any screen protectors, these were somewhat hard to put on, but I got it on my second try. The included lint-tape is VERY helpful. My only complaint is that the cut appears to be slightly off on the earpiece and camera holes. I got the screen protector perfectly centered, but the holes extend far to the left of the camera and earpiece (though they are still left uncovered). Nonetheless, very satisfied and the protector is nice and clear. Definitely recommend.Edit 12/27/12: Just read an explanation by the manufacturer that the cut is off so as not to cover the ambient light sensors. Updated to 5/5 stars.
0.7528841	0.6996560000000001	the product was shipped and received very fast. the screen protectors work great. you can sometimes see the fingerprints on your screen however, most of the time one cannot.
0.9956573000000001	0.8358429	If you've decided to protect your iPhone screen, these Tech Armor screen covers are a great choice. The quality is solid and the price is very reasonable. Just remember to take your time and read the instructions when installing. Be patient and you will have zero bubbles and will soon forget that it's even there. I would certainly buy these again when the time comes.
0.9969146000000001	0.8107631	Fits iPhone 5 great. Ordered on a Wednesday and got it on Saturday. Love the matte finish. Easy to put on and no bubbles!!
0.019030005	0.5431423000000001	"The screen protector itself wasn't terrible. However after about 3 months it began to come off at the edges. So I tried utilizing the ""Lifetime Replacement Warranty"" and discovered they have no organized manner in which to get a replacement. I was told I had to email them my order number, which I did - to no further response. So I won't be ordering from them again."
0.8175816999999999	0.748272	The screen cover on the iPhone 5 is very nice because the feel is very smooth and often times I get annoyed by the fact that there might be fingerprints on my screen so the fact that it's anti-fingerprint is a plus and that there's really no glare is also nice.
0.95476913	0.75740427	Great Privacy Protector!Its anti-fingerprint the feel of the Film is very smooth.Dims screen a little althought that is expected of this product. I wouldn't say it bothers me at all.easy to apply, got it one try.
0.9992448	0.8731668	These screen protectors fit perfect. These are the best shields i've installed on our IPhones.  the kids tend to bang them up quite often, these appear to last.  Went on smooth and east, perfect
0.99632347	0.83511186	Easy to install. Perfect fit for iPhone 5. There is no finger print left after used. Excellent product. Recommend for all iPhone 5 user
0.81422406	0.45011955	I really needed a screen protector for my iphone 5. I like how it cheap and it has three of them
0.91598755	0.45910826	Easy instructions to follow. The product comes with everything you need to instal the screen protector, too. I didn't need to reinstall it.
0.7159984	0.07802200000000001	A b c d e F g h o j k l M n o p q R T u v x z a b c d e F g h o j k l M n o p q R S T u v x zVery good
0.9977978000000001	0.76055294	This was major test for me. I had bought Generiks before and loved them. However, the ease of putting these covers was amazing. It takes hold easier and allows changes easier as well. I recommend highly
0.9936513000000001	0.82174706	I've used Tech Armor screen protectors in the past so I knew it was the brand to get for my new iPhone 5. No glare, no fingerprints, and no greasiness like with the screen protector that came with the iPhone case I purchased. Love the product and will use them again for future purchases. Very easy to install. The package comes with three, but I know the first one I've installed will last for years because my previous iPhone was able to keep the same screen protector for over two years now.
0.00171718	0.43419945	Unclear instructions, failed to stick to the screen for a reasonable time and awful tech support. A waste of time and money. Many better screen protectors available. Stay away  from this product.
0.99629927	0.81519115	These screen protectors look and feel really fantastic and were incredibly easy to put on and the best part,no bubbles!
0.9966799999999999	0.8479743000000001	Excellent,This bumper case if perfect for the iPhone 5. I just received this in the mail and put it right on the phone and it is PERFECT. All cut outs line up, it keeps the phone sleek and light, and shows off that very stylish body of the new iPhone
0.39320257	0.53373194	Good Product. SInce i was installing this for the first time. i got it right on my second attempt. I checked out the video on youtube and then installed. They should provide the video link either on the product or while purchasing.
0.98283094	0.7384006999999999	I did pretty well putting it on the first time and I love that my screen is getting protected.  I forget it's on there- it's that clear.
0.92159426	0.47529668	Finally, I've been waiting for this screen protector. I love it. Had on my iphone 4 and now that i have the iphone5, i don't have people being all in my business. :-)
0.93561286	0.7464193	I was very satisfied with these screen protectors. It is really anti-glare. I feel like it they are better quality that the more expensive ones. I paid $30 for another brand and it got black a few weeks later. This protector still looks like new.
0.9989295	0.76178604	It is lovely for the price. cheapest and best quality for the price. great quality. I love it. and I recommend it 100%
0.78462553	0.70193946	I am very satisfied with this product. The clarity is excellent. I am hoping it proves to be strong too at protecting against scratches. It does however show smudges from skin oil much more so than not having a screen protector. All in all, a fair trade off.
0.9830054	0.70665973	I've purchased other screen protectors in the past, but this one is by far the best.  Easy to go on, virtually unnoticable and almost bubble free.Seems like a great product.
0.69983757	0.78922355	Inexpensive and easy to apply.I would purchase the screen protectors again in.No bubbles and hasn't scratched after being on phone for a couple of months.
0.8665099	0.82922155	after watching the YouTube video and reading the instructions, I still had 3 significant sized bubbles appear. The film is a VERY tight fit, which I love, however, there is NO room for error, and if you are off even a few degrees, as I was, when aligning the bottom, by the time I got to the top, the film was covering the camera lens a bit. I had to un peel, and restart 3 times, and finally got it aligned correctly, and most likely the re tries are what enabled the dust to create the for mentioned bubbles. Cant really blame the maker, as they do provide significant instructions, just a warning to those that buy, that even in a completely cleaned area like I had, make sure you are aligned perfectly, or you will either end up with bubbles, or having to use 1 of the 2 remaining covers.Having said all that, these covers are really nice and nearly invisible. They don't seem to pick up finger prints like other covers I have purchased, and for the price, these are definitely worth the purchase.
0.92137396	0.76846075	It does what it is supposed to do. I have had it for 3 months and it is still super clear. Easy to clean.
0.9813516	0.7925099	I love these covers. This is the second batch I've ordered. I wouldn't say they are EASY to put on, but they're just as easy as any other cover.
0.6249147	0.5541626000000001	So far so good product went on easily with no bubbles. When putting on the case the product continued to adhere well.
0.7315630999999999	0.3638535	Product comes with detailed instruction booklet and link to a demonstration video. Watch the video to save yourself time and frustration with installation.
0.99807394	0.8387972	strong easy to use, minimizes the reflection. esy to apply and cost is very reasonable for the quality. highly recc
0.5983099000000001	0.67260355	A problem I noticed with screen protectors is that it doesn't always fit the phone perfectly. After applying the screen protector I noticed that it's a little smaller than the frame of the phone; it didn't cover the iphone to the very edge and the circle for the home button is a little bigger than the button. It could also just have been my applying the screen protector was bad. But I didn't have trouble applying the screen protector at all.
0.5322365	0.6124623	Absolutely amazing screen cover! Easy to apply. Like any other screen protector, you'll want to do this in a dust-free environment. Despite capturing a few bits of dust beneath the cover, I discovered after a few days that the bubbles encapsulating those dust specks disappeared. I read some reviews about others' covers not lining up or having scratches. Perhaps their product came from a poorly made batch. I would grade its sizing fit as 95-99% because 100% fit is nearly impossible. I forgot to mention that the cover feels smooth like the texture of a plastic water bottle. It does not have a sticky feel.
0.4039624	0.6194185999999999	"May be it will take a few times of practice, but applying the tech armor was much more difficult than the demo video.  In particular I found removing ""Tab 2"" to be nearly impossible -- kept peeling up the armor no matter how i tried to hold it in place and was very sticking compared to what is shown in the video.  The tab also left a thick glue residue on the armor, I had to do a lot of scraping and buffing to get it clean."
0.97795856	0.73844177	I have been pleased with this screen protector. What set the experience of this purchase apart was the customer service, including a follow-up email after I received the item with a link for instructions, reminder about the warranty, and encouragement to contact them. I felt that they really cared that I was 100% satisfied.
0.31996202	0.44749504	"Unless you have had experience putting these on, you can expect ""bubble city"".  You can easily go through all 3 screens without success."
0.74362296	0.5967233000000001	I bought another one first that was crazy expensive from the ATT store that was a &#34;Dry&#34; application. I ended up screwing it up super hard to put on and you only got one. I was buying a case on Amazon and figured what the heck might as well try these out too. Put the first one on and man this is the easiest screen protector I have even installed. Perfect the first time and I got two spares. Don't waste your money on other expensive ones buy this!
0.90218794	0.82302487	The anti-glare function works pretty well.  This is one of the better anti-glare materials out there.  It goes not obscure the retina display quality.  The screen fit is great -- there are no gaps around the edges, which is great.  I can see why this is a best seller.
0.9335237	0.7773576	Good if you install it correctly the first time. The numbers on the tabs when installing are tiny but make sure you look for them. Watching the install video they recommend is actually helpful and only about a minute long.  Screen protector fits well with cases that don't wrap over the edge of the phone. Not sure how they would do with a case that is bulkier.
0.88700724	0.77328616	Great works perfectly. But be careful it collects dust hairs really easily that will stick to the front of your phone. Other then that it's a great product.
0.26245597	0.47230417	The covers fit nicely but do have residual bubbles that I have not found a way to get rid of!
0.99773026	0.8333985999999999	Easy to apply and protects nicely. Loved the price for the protector. Have used some protectors in the past that are too thin and I was happy this product had a nice thickness to protect the screen.
0.009887725	0.4514816	"I tried following the instructions to the T, but I still get a terrible result. the finished ""screen protector"" has a sticker tag on it and when you try to remove it, the screen protecter gets pulled off or kinked, and the sticker tag leaves an adhesive residue on the outside of the screen protector. i have never had good luck with these types of protectors so it might just be me."
0.9950460999999999	0.7095984000000001	Wow, so impressed! This is truly a superior product that makes all of the rest look like mud! Any device you may have, they make the protection for it and I highly advise getting a couple to keep your products clean and protected.
0.96985173	0.7461269	easy application, matte, and very smooth. I messed up the first time but I was able to lift the film and try again ! At first, I had a few bubbles, but at the end of the day, they disappeared! I love it! The film covers the entire screen, no open spaces
0.9925904000000001	0.7761361999999999	I love this screen protector. I first had an anti glare matte screen, and I hated it because made everything fuzzy! I put this screen protector on, and I couldn't even tell there was something on it! I love the clear precision!!
0.97855294	0.7563573	I bought a simular product at Best Buy, 1 protector for $20 and after the first application I had to pull it off to fix it. It then decided to stick to itself and I couldn't use it again. Frusterated I just threw it away and went on Amazon. I'm SO glad I did because I found this product. So easy to use and works so well. Plus I get three! I would highly reccommend these to anyone!
0.88421285	0.78452003	The screen protector works great. I barely even notice it's there. It does not hinder the beautiful graphics of the iPhone.
0.05448827	0.41767165	I was a little disappointed with these screen protecters. They came in a pack of 3, and I have already used all three of them in about a week trying to get it on perfect. I have air bubbles in the corners that will not go away. I have tried to use the card to push them out, and I have taken off the screen protecter and tried another one. I have used all of them now and all seem to have the same problem: some air bubbles will not go away! It protects the screen well, I'm just frustrated that I have air bubbles that will not go away. I also followed the directions when applying them, so I don't understand what happened.
0.9963337	0.8284148000000001	I was very happy with how easy it was to get the screen protector on without any bubbles or lint underneath (as long as you follow the instructions). I love the screen protector and can barely tell it is there. It doesn't make the picture blurry or fuzzy at all - overall a great product.
0.9984951999999999	0.86167383	Privacy detail on this is exactly as described. Fits onto iPhone 5 really well and works even underneath an Otterbox case.
0.56920147	0.45854568	This product was easier to put on my phone than I thought it was going to be.  It did not leave bubbles or dirt under the screen.  I am very happy with my purchase.
0.98538655	0.73993623	This is a great screen cover so far. only a few days but i love it. HD picture. Thanks !
0.9277271999999999	0.81468785	I always buy multiples of these just in case I screw up when applying, but I got this one on the first try. The dust removal tape works way better than the piece of scotch tape method; I was very pleased with it, it grabbed a cat/dog hair with no trouble. It's only been 2 days, but the protector isn't getting scratched and scraped up already like some cheaper protectors do. Would definitely buy these again.One tip: Although it says to remove the entire backing before applying, I peel off only one edge, start applying, and then peel the backing off while smoothing it down and across. You get a lot less dust that way, and it's easier to recover if you find you're not putting it on straight.
0.9302833	0.7771461999999999	"Just installed this yesterday, easy to apply and had no problem with bubbles. Just take your time and you're golden. I like the way it feels, even though at first I thought it was going to provide some resistance to my swiping, that appears to have gone away very quickly. Unlike other screen protectors I have had, this one covers the sensor next to the front facing camera. I don't know if this will be a problem or not but it was just something I noticed. Comes with three protectors, dust removal tape (which is infinitely helpful if you have a pesky piece of dust under your screen protector), and a very sturdy ""smoother"" card. Overall great product and I would recommend it to anyone."
0.9987627	0.8200075000000001	Awesome screen cover! Easy to place and no air bubbles under the cover.  The best brand I've seen yet (I've purchased several others in the past).  Highly recommend!
0.9748534	0.8174335	It was soooo easy to put on! It went on in seconds and worked perfectly the first time. There was no air bubbles or lifted edges! Such good quality and a pretty great price.
0.9979306	0.766237	Love that there are 3 in the package. Simple directions were easy to follow! I'm very pleased with the quality of this product!
0.5636057	0.6736133000000001	The iPhone 5 has a great screen with wonderful detail and depth of color.  Add this screen protector and you lose all that quality.I dealt with it for about a week and then tossed it in the trash.  I've used screen protectors on my previous iPhones, none of those were such poor quality as this one.
0.6973020000000001	0.7458533	Went on with no problems and very quickly (first try) a new record.Kills glare and protects the phone screen, no visible issues with screen resolution
0.9888283000000001	0.7816769	This was exactly was I was looking for. Very reasonably priced for a three pack of the screen protectors. At the Verizon store, 1 protector is about $30.
0.9883671	0.7642770999999999	Just got this today and it is totally amazing, it's super easy to put on, it doesn't even look like my phone has one on and I have 2 more left. MUST GET!!!
0.9924767	0.83436143	the screen protectors are great, they are easy to attach and remove if needed, i can still see everything very clearly on the screen
0.9861059000000001	0.8521718	I was hesitant to purchase these due to some complaints about people having to use all 3 covers before they applied correctly, but I had no such problems.I did have to reapply it two or three times - using the same protector - but it now sits just fine with no bubbles, dust, or smudges.The protector is a bit thinner than the width of the iPhone itself, but covers the screen well and with a case on all edges are protected.My only complaint is that the screen does pick up fingerprints very easily, but they also rub off just as easily.I would absolutely recommend this product and will buy these again if needed.
0.67558223	0.63833535	The product came in time and everything! Not only that but the screen protector you can hardly notice it's on your phone at all! Great screen protector, I even got it on on the first try. If your a kind of person you struggles with putting on screen protectors I suggest wiping the screen first, then use tape to remove what ever dust fell on your screen and place your screen protector!
0.6991253000000001	0.58814335	The protector came with applicator and wipe for easy installation.  The protector even kept my screen protected when my dogs knocked my phone off the coffee table and onto a project with sharp metal pieces.  The protector got scratched to hell and even tore but my screen was fine.
0.07110378	0.55153346	I was hopeful that this screensaver would be anti-fingerprint, but it is definitely not. When I press the lock button on my phone, I can see big smudges most of the time. I'm constantly wiping off the screen. If you're okay with wiping off the screen, these do the job. I just get frustrated that the product claims to be anti-fingerprint when it is not at all. I ordered the crystal clear for my sister's 4S, and those actually seem to be more smudge free.
0.9704255999999999	0.6802019	what a great deal on 3 screen protecters. i love the matte ones for the no glare. the only thing i don't like is how they make my screen look grainy.
0.8566707	0.7933581000000001	For my iphone 5, I originally got an anti-glare film (Power Support/Ebisu Tokyo) from the Apple Store...I did not like the fuzziness of this film...reduced the clarity of the iphone screen.  So I got the Tech Armor Screen Protector (not an anti-glare screen).  The screen is very clear (does not reduce the iphone resolution).  Size is perfect...not too close to the edges that would require a perfect placement.  However, be prepared for 2 or 3 attempts to get this right...comes with 3 screens, the other reason why I bought this product. I have a shaky hand so I typically need 2 or 3 attempts to get a good placement.  first two attempts, had some air bubbles cause of some dust, and also some smudges due to re-attempts to put it back on...third attempt was perfect!  Air bubbles disappeared using the cardboard and put it on perfectly.  Great screen.  Ordering this again for my wife's phone.
0.99679923	0.73378223	I love it!!!  Very easy to apply and then you have two extras in case you mess up.  Compare to similar items that I have seen gotton for other phone, this is by far the best.
0.23779953	0.6722210999999999	Of the three screen protectors in the package that I received only one applied properly. With the other two, when I got to the final step where you remove tab 2, the tabs did not peal off cleanly and glue remained on the screen protector.UPDATE: Tech Armor contacted me about the problem I had removing the tab. It turns out that the second tab is not attached to the screen protector but to a separate layer of plastic. Instead of trying to peel off the tab as I did, you should use the tab to remove the last outer layer. I looked at one of the screen protectors that I had discarded and sure enough there were two layers of plastic.Tech Armor stands behind its product to the extent that they are sending a replacement even though the error was mostly my fault. My only suggestion is that that warn others somehow not to make my mistake.
0.04771003	0.35116640000000005	The fit of the film is not exactly 100% it's impossible to align it w/buttons and ear hole/camera.  everything else is ok about it thought no reason to buy one from a store.
0.99503493	0.7657221	Best screen HD screen protector I've ever bought. Its easy to apply and you can't tell you have it on your phone. The price was great too.
0.99652886	0.8735205	this film is excellent quality, allows the correct use my iphone, perfect fits to size, maybe could be a little thinner.highly recommendedand not grate easily and does not reflect, very goodnot interfere with the use of my iphonemaybe if it were a little thinner would be a little more sensitive
0.9976754000000001	0.8429989999999999	The Tech Armor screen protector was very easy to apply, resist scratches and I love the matte finish!! You can't beat it for the  price.
0.9227245999999999	0.7889826999999999	This is an awesome deal for 3 protectors. I messed up on applying one of them, but that was because I didn't align it properly. Once this protector is on, it is literally invisible. You can't tell that it is on there at all. It doesn't affect the feel of the screen or the way the screen looks (brightness and resolution). I Like it much better than the Invisishield which I have tried before, and is not invisible and much more expensive.
0.98299587	0.7661198	Both myself and my wife really like this product. In addition to the anti-glare function of the protector, it adds a nice feel when interacting with the screen.
0.9980978000000001	0.8793405000000001	Disclaimer: This is my first experience with applying a screen protector onto my iPhone. I ran into some trouble early in my journey, but with the help of Tech Armor I'd say they turned me into one happy loyal customer.Overall, this is a great product, but to apply a screen protector it does not hurt if one is dexterous, nifty and patient.The cover offers great screen protection, I like the matte finish, the image on the iPhone is not altered much, the protector fits well, my fingerprints don't stay on the screen, and it is a fantastic value. Note of caution however, I found it a bit tricky to attach the cover to my phone and both times that I tried I ended up having tiny lint pieces fly under the get stuck on the screen cover during the installation process. After ruining 2 covers I threw my hands up.Customer service of Tech Armor helped me tremendously, they were amazing and super helpful! They sent me 3 replacement covers, free of charge and very quickly too.When I tried to apply the protector again I did a bit of prep work: I watched the instructional video, read advice from other users, washed my hands, rolled up my sleeves, braced myself and got to work.This time I was able to apply the new replacement screen on the first try. No dirt or dust particles!Everything worked like a charm and now my iPhone is protected happy.Fabulous product + Great value + Out of this world customer service = iPhone bliss!
0.640229	0.7097523	It was easy to apply but after using it, it shows oil from your fingers.  It also has an air bubble on the edge that I can't get rid of.  I've used Zagg in the past and was impressed with the HD Zagg film protector.  The price on this product is right and it does provide protection but next protector will be a Zagg.
0.9626969000000001	0.7531842	Overall, I am pleased with these covers. They do what they are supposed to do, but smudge pretty easy, and hold onto fingerprints. Minor issues, but thats why I docked one star.
0.028031081	0.48363853	the camera and earphone holes are not cut in the center so in lining them up with the phone the screen protector runs off the right edge. ridiculous
0.98710287	0.86128426	I would definitely recommend these screen protectors! I'm very pleased with these screen protectors. They were easy to put on the phones.  I've never had success in putting screen protectors on without have the annoying bubbles.  I was able to put these screen protectors on two i-phones with no bubbles.
0.99070567	0.8154878000000001	This is a great product - as expected fits well on the iPhone. There were no issues, the screen protector fitted just fine on the phone and is very useful.
0.0023803413	0.64823425	"Clearly in the description on Amazon it reads ""Tech Armor for 5s / 5c / iPhone 5"".  Clearly the image of the packaging they display on Amazon shows 5s and 5c printed on the package.  I order this product specifically bc of the 5s and the finger scanner compatibility that I was receiving today. However, the package I received in the mail wasn't the same that is advertised here at all.  They sent me a completely different looking package that only says iPhone 5 compatible on the box.  They either sent me the wrong package or they completely lie about what you're buying.  They clearly advertise one thing, but send you a completely different product and hope you don't complain.  In the end, i only wasted $10, but don't let them waste your $10 too.  If you only own the iPhone 5 or 5c, this screen will still work.  However, don't get this if you're expecting a compatible version with a cut out big enough around the home button for the 5s's ""touch ID"" system."
0.9345858	0.8259304	In the past I never spent much on screen protectors for my electronics thinking they were all basically the same until I saw this product. I was hesitant to buy it at first but I wanted to see what a few more bucks would get me. I think it was worth the few extra. The matte finish helps when using my phone in the sun, plus I think it looks nice. It feels smooth and responsive to the touch when operating the touch screen. I have had some screen protectors in the past that made your fingers stick/grip the screen. Installation was not exact, but that was user error, the product is solid and I would recommend this to iPhone 5 users.
0.98090386	0.86102843	Screen protector is of much higher quality than that ones that often come packaged with cases. It is a bit thicker and seems more durable. It does not get scratched easily. Also, this screen protector was very easy to install without any trapped bubbles or other issues. If you don't get it lined up perfectly on the first try, you can easily pull it back and try again - no messy adhesive left behind, and no loss of adhesion to the screen.
0.96552664	0.62394917	I love how there were no air bubbles but lining it up takes some practice till you get it perfect! I also love how there are 3 so you don't need to run to the store when one gets ruined.
0.99817175	0.83785987	This product is really, REALLY easy to install, virtually invisible and completely compatible with the iPhone 5 touch screen. I gave the others to friends with my highest recommendation, and I ordered myself another set just to be ready in case I need to replace the one I applied, though it has shown no signs of edge curling or slipping so far. I'm very pleased with the quality and ease of use of this product and recommend it to everyone with an iPhone.
0.8944726999999999	0.76995254	Nice, easy fitting screen protectors, can't tell it's even there.  I was unaware that both sides of the screen protector had a film on them to cover the actual piece that goes on the phone, but oh well, live and learn.  Good purchase.
0.9996215	0.7676494	Works as advertised, easy to place without bubbles.  Easy to follow instructions online also, highly recommended if you need a protector.
0.2839717	0.44335909999999995	I got an iPhone 5 as an early Christmas present last week and thought I would be okay with buying the screen protector from the AT&T store and having them apply it for me. However, my screen protector started to lift a few days ago due to poor quality of the brand they advertise. Instead of having them replace it, I purchased this product and applied it myself. Got it perfect my first try and with no dust issues. Very happy with this product. Thank you very much.
0.25459543	0.35968092	These are my go to screen savers. Not like the crap they try to sell you at Best Buy. ..
0.90612996	0.79962397	I am very fingerprint-a-phobic, I can't stand them on my screens.  This is great for anti-fingerprint and the feel is nce, very smoth swiping.  The downfall is that it does cut down on the quality of the image on the screen a bit, but foe me it's a trade off I am willing to take.The anti-fingerprint films always seem a bit easier to install too!
0.99463487	0.7546076999999999	Easy to install, looks great..I am very happy with this product. If you are in the market for a screen protector for Iphone 5 look no further.
0.8064905	0.46769586	This protector does a good job. I recommend watching their website video as to how to apply it though.The application is not difficult but easy to screw up if you aren't paying attention.I would definitely buy this protector again.
0.020588368	0.45088673	The screen protectors are extremely difficult to put on due to poor tab placement as well as failing to cut screen cut-outs for the camera and speaker properly.The instructions claim there is a second &#34;remove me&#34; tab, but none of the three I received came with one. One would think that a product fit for sale would be properly packaged with instructions that accurately described how to use the product.A decent screen protector would have come with two tabs to allow ease of installation as well as properly made cut-outs.Alignment was difficult and disastrous, leading to three &#34;screen protectors&#34; in the garbage. Would not recommend.
0.9810504999999999	0.7151519000000001	Hey so far so good. Got it fast and got it on first try using instructions and dust removal sticker. It's been good thus far.
0.9981254999999999	0.83501595	I just applied the protector to my new 5S and I was very happy to see it fits perfectly.  I was concerned about the home button but it is the same size as my 5.  EVERY protector can get dust underneath or bubbles...that is the fault of the installer not the product LOL...so don't let negative reviews sway you.  I got one piece of dust underneath and I just lifted the protector with a piece of tape and with another piece of tape wrapped around my finger...I was able to pull off the dust with out a problem.  I have been applying these for years and it sure takes practice.  I learned by going to YouTube and watching and learning. Installing protector in a well steamed bathroom helps because apparently steam in the air eliminates dust in the air.  I have only done that once over the years...and mainly just do it in my office where I can concentrate and relax.
0.999174	0.73820007	Love the look and feel it gives the phone. Received it super fast.Easy to put on and comes with everything to make it nice and bubble free. Highly recommended.
0.98504645	0.8020475	One of the best screen protectors I've ever used and not a single bubble!!!! Clear and smooth to the touch!!!!
0.9887823	0.76523423	I love the privacy screen.  It works just as described and those who try to look over my shoulder to read what's on my phone can't see a thing!  Great product!
0.48604217	0.5600434	I actually bought this for my iPhone 4 and didn't pay attention to the fact that this is for the iPhone 5.  OOPS!!! rather than return it i just cut it to fit my phone and it works fine.  I am giving 4/5 because the price is a bit high for what looks like standard matte sticky film cut to a phone template.
0.9854654	0.5826456999999999	Installs easily, provides good protection! Would recommend to friends! Eleven more words required, 7 more words requiredThree more words required! Finally!
0.79644203	0.720438	Just installed the screen protector went on easily and i was happy to see it came with some dust removal tape and wipe cloth. It made it easy to get on and had NO bubbles, almost instantly sealed to my phone...nice!! Only disappointment is that i went back into the pack to install the back but it only comes with 3 front screen protectors, don't know why i thought it would come with both, but seems to make sense that someone would wNt to protect both sides of their phone. Other than that the front part is great
0.71506906	0.7201805	"Product: Anti-glare/matteType ordered: iPhone 5/Galaxy S3Count: 3-packFirst of all, this is a combined review of mine and my girlfriend's experience with this product. While mine was uneventful as I got the package and I succeeded in applying my screen protector, my girlfriend's experience was a different, but positive one nonetheless. Now, let me point out that my girlfriend is extremely clumsy, OCD, and meticulous when it comes to phones.She ordered both the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy S3 screen protectors and received them in 3 days. I got mine from Amazon while she got hers from TechArmor eBay. When she received the products, she had difficulty applying them correctly due to dust and creases while lifting up the screen when she messed up. At the end of it all, she used up all of her iPhone 5 screen protectors, with the last one being applied decently and 2/3 of her GS3 ones. We followed the instructional video as well as the ""steam advice"" (I used that method actually, not her. Hence all of her errors, lol).Because we paid 7 dollars for each of the packs, we decided to e-mail customer service to see if they could do something about the failed-attempt screen protectors that we just received. It said that the lifetime warranty applied to application errors as well as normal wear and tear. We contacted customer service via e-mail explaining what happened, and they responded promptly with a request for the order information. After we gave the information to them, they said that they would send us new replacements for the screen protectors.These new protectors arrived within a few days. We have never received customer service like this for screen protectors. Usually, we would get screen protectors for the same price, but of a lower quality (they would get scratched up easily, lift at the corners, have a weird rainbow sheen, etc.) and they definitely did not come with a lifetime warranty. On another positive note, for all you people who like interchanging cases but don't like the lifting it causes for whatever screen protector you're using, this is a great product as my girlfriend has changed from Otterboxes (Commuter) to slimmer fit TPU cases and the screen protector has stayed put. Overall, product is amazing, fits phones according to specifications, greatly reduces glare and is well worth the money.MJB & ALN"
0.8539392	0.6756151	bought this for my wife. it makes for a real clear picture on her phone. was a little mad about the price listed for 6.00 got the bill was charged 10.00 oh well
0.9415380999999999	0.56306964	I had some difficulty putting on the film (my fault, not the product). I contacted the company and they immediately sent me an instruction video so I could apply the film correctly. I am very pleased with the results and with the quick, polite and helpful response of the Tech Armor company
0.99325335	0.7983946999999999	Great product great price. Tip: follow the instructions . No need to pay$20 these covers are totally see through, you won't even know they're on
0.6137090999999999	0.5661474	The product works very well. The key to it is taking extreme care during installation and making sure the phone surface is spotless and the glass protector is centered properly on the first try. You wont even know it's there.
0.14747787	0.4374299	I NEVER write amazon reviews, but please dear buyer, listen to me.  Do not buy this.  You can EASILY tell a difference in the quality of the image from your iphone with this protector (quality goes down).  It almost looks greasy, although it is not.  Something with the matte finish.  Sure, it's anti glare and anti fingerprint, but your bought an expensive iPhone to enjoy that high quality screen resolution.  Don't ruin it with this protector.
0.55031013	0.46098456	Maybe I didn't follow directions exactly the first time but it took me a second sheet before I was happy with the results. Not a fault of the product, just human error. Luckily there are three sheets aka three tries!
0.9132486999999999	0.6749265	I did struggle a bit putting on all three and got some air bubbles but this is a good product. It was a little bit difficult to put them on. That being said--I wasn't sure if I needed a screen protector and I'm glad I got this.
0.23621774	0.534651	"never had any success with these screen savers. just got iphone 5 - decided to go ahead and try this product - 2 problems - freaking tag didn't pull off properly and left behind pieces of the tag and adhesive. and of course the normal problem, putting it on so that there are no bubbles or bits of ""stuff"".......there goes $6......oh well"
0.8294171	0.6545295999999999	I like this product, however finger prints are more evident than expected.  Otherwise a good product and easy to install.
0.9822283000000002	0.76690876	First pack I ordered through Amazon arrived and I started cleaning my screen and got ready to put the screen covers on when I realized it came with everything but the screen covers!  I emailed the customer support, got an email back at 10pm and they shipped a replacment out the day!With that said, the screen covers are awesome! The cutouts for the home button, speaker and camera are perfect!
0.8081822	0.7208496999999999	Once I put it on and got out the bubbles (be persistent as they say)it was great.No glare or fingerprints .
0.80636585	0.6688149	"only had it a couple weeks.. but was easy to install and seems to be protecting well so far.. I like the non-glare but feels a little ""grainier"" than some I've had in the past but not a big deal."
0.065321475	0.48783190000000004	I purchased a Tech Armor HD Clear screen protector for my Iphone5. I am on my 3rd screen protector attempt to get this to work. The first two attempts the screen protector seemed to get scratched when smoothing out the air bubbles.On the 3rd attempt I watched the video, washed my hands, used the cleaning cloth and scotch tape to remove dust before applying. I applied the screen protector however, when trying to remove the 2nd blue tab, there does not seem to be another layer under neath and when the blue sticker is removed it leaves glue on the screen protector. I was able to get the top layer off off of one of the corners.  Tech Armor also agreed to send a replacement set of screen protectors. Their customer service was responsive.
0.98678553	0.7382711	But I can for this one. It just works great. Compared to other screen protectors the installation is cake and for some miracle they don't show any dust specks despite my apartment being dust filled. I've tried the Amazon brand and the Skintomi brand and this is just leagues better and simpler.
0.9977219999999999	0.85543656	This is the first screen protector I ever had that just went on easily, no bubbles, no problems. Impressive. Invisible. Excellent clarity. Fast shipping. Good price. BUY IT!
0.99572456	0.8203052	The tech armor I phone 5 anti glare and anti fingerprint iphone 5 cover fits very good and works great.
0.952033	0.7164924	Most screen protectors only come with one set, which if you mess up, you're done. This one comes with 3, and I succeed on the 2nd try. Very good quality and fits the iPhone 5 very well. Thanks!
0.6276921	0.57641363	Works great, easy to put on to the iPhone 5.  The look is odd to get used to but not bad at all.
0.9538945	0.8555676	This was very easy to install on my phone - no bubbles or issues. Works much better than the screen protector that came with the case I purchased - this one appears to handle the glare pretty well. Everything looks clear on the screen and fingerprints aren't too obvious.
0.9866693000000001	0.7966108000000001	This is a great product for protecting your smart phone.  It was easy to apply without putting bubbles between the screen and the screen protector. By receiving three protctor sheets, I'm sure I won't need to replace them often.
0.9973309000000001	0.8936900999999999	I've worked with cell phones for a long time, and these are by far the best screen protectors for the price!I'm a big a believer in screen protectors protecting the screen of your phone as well as being very discreet.These screen protectors do just that! Once the screen protector is on, you can't even tell it's on your phone!It is also very protective when it comes to scratches. I have dropped my phone more than I would like to admit, and although the screen protector may be getting scratched, it has protected the actual screen itself. Definitely recommend these screen protectors to anyone who wants to protect their screen without having it look like you have a screen protector on! :)
0.99811685	0.8119878	I love this matte screen protector. This is my first matte screen protector and I'm loving it so much. It doesn't leave fingerprints and even if it does, it cleanses with just a tissue and water. No glare, visual is still good and feeling is amazing.
0.92790234	0.7839436	Love these matte screen protectors. They work really well your finger does not slide to wrong letter while texting .
0.98165476	0.70155025	Received sooner than I thought I would.  I followed the easy instructions and it is great! Much better then the protector I got from the service provider when I purchased my iPhone 5.  No prints and I am not constantly cleaning it like the previous protector.  Great buy!!! I am very happy with it.
0.4290713	0.575051	As for the matte texture the product promises, it does deliver. I don't have to fight with glares anymore. A mild issue I had, was putting on the screen protector, as I'm not the best screen protector applier. It came with a few nice tools to help you apply it properly, which I thought was nice. As for looking at the screen itself, it appears a little gritty, and I found that kind of annoying. But after you get used to it, you come to find it's a decent protector. :)As for shipping, it came within the week I ordered it, and a day before expected!
0.95940197	0.73846185	i love it- easy to put on without bubbles, looks good on and feels good too. smudges a little but it wipes off.
0.42445429999999995	0.5693665	I bought an Otterbox phone cover and tried using the screen protector that came with it. It was horrible and while I'm sure I probably just fail at applying these, it still should not have been that hard! I bought these as a replacement and they went on SO much easier. No bubbles. No major issues. Thank you for making my life easier.
0.98870444	0.7823353	Has all the tools that you need to apply the screen protectors with no dust or bubbles underneath.  I am very pleased with how easy it went on.
0.4559021	0.51632494	So far so good! I did have trouble placing the screen protector on my iphone though...I wasted one. The second time I placed it on my phone, there were less bubbles than the first one. The third one I gave to my dad, although he did have trouble with placing the screen protector on. I should do my research next time to place the protector on...
0.8398613000000001	0.76033056	it gets the job done of protecting my iphone 5 screen so i'm not fussing over the little &#34;HD&#34; detail right now.like other reviewers said the holes for the front camera and ear speaker are more elongated and don't fit perfectly over them but as the company said, there is a reason for that.touch screen isn't affected at all by this.the only downside i guess is there's finger smudges that are visible when your screen is off but that doesn't phase me.i would recommend this - for the price and quality
0.07539785	0.30964744	So much bubbles and I used all of them never screen I ever brought never buying one from this again
0.9905991	0.77092457	The product is great, its very easy to install no bubbles in the screen. The feature that I like more is that this screen protector is truly invisible.
0.96931374	0.56206495	this product is of good quality and was deliver real fast  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
0.9877457000000001	0.7025726999999999	Best iphone 5 screen protectors!! They are very expensive at stores, and they are not as good as tech armor's.
0.65971804	0.5102557	I've had this protector screen for both iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. It never fails me! I will always purchase this protector screen. It gives protection without sacrificing clarity.
0.97451997	0.8531434999999999	The screen protector is great in that it is easy to install and it keeps fingerprints off - I love the matte effect on it!  I've had it on for about a week now, and there are still no fingerprints, and the screen protector appears to be there to stay for a while - glad someone finally came out with a screen protector that seems to have durability.  I've used a handful of other screen protectors that had lifetime guarantees and they had to be replaced within a couple of months.  There were noticeable problems with those from the onset, so I am hopeful this one will last quite a long time.  And, there's still 2 more of them for when/if I need to replace this one!
0.44696388	0.5934562	I love these screen protectors.  I do not see reflection off my screen. I do not have to clean the screen as often.
0.9917901	0.7249144000000001	Great piece for my Iphone 5S. Seems to be improved (from a quality standpoint) from the last time I ordered this for my Iphone 5, as well.Very easy installation! No waiting time either, which is nice.Good to know that it comes with a lifetime warranty, although I'm unsure of how to activate this.I will definitely be ordering this for my Iphone 6, so Tech Armor, I hope you're studying those mock ups and building a product base already;)
0.99497104	0.9075601000000001	At first I was disappointed I purchased the anti-glare version I did not like the feel of it. After an hour of use I now prefer the it and will not even consider another clear screen protector. I installed this screen protector on 5 new phones without any issues. I have been careful with my new phone so I don't know how well it protects against scratches from keys in you pocket. It feels thick enough to protect the phone.Pros:+ perfect fit. At first I thought the front-facing camera cut out was off-centered, then I released it was like that for the proximity and light sensors.+ easier (no air bubbles) to install then other screen protectors+ no visible finger prints after 50 plus hours of use+ easily view the screen in bright sunlight even with sunglasses on+ priceCons:- colors are slightly washed out. I only noticed because I had another phone without a screen protector to compare it to. The colors are still very vibrant, so this does not affect my overall review. Most people won't notice any difference.- the cardboard squeegee works, but a driver license or credit card helps with the installation.Note, I have had a number of people ask me what screen protector I am using because they want one for their phone.
0.9947585999999999	0.8263921999999999	Tech Armor goes out of their way to make it simple.  No surprises and the product is very easy to apply and durable.
0.971985	0.5829456000000001	When I ordered this product, I must say I was skeptical. Only because there were so many other similar products out there. In the end they work great and that's all that matters.
0.1330874	0.64434016	The fact that it's only the front cover was kind of disapointing. I had to go and a back cover separately. I would rather have only one set of both (back and front) than 3 pieces of the front only.The material is ok and wasn't that hard to install.
0.96192783	0.83646363	Perfect screen protector and privacy screen. Looks really good on my black iPhone5. Went on easily and I got out any air bubbles. As far as people reviewing this product and saying the privacy doesn't work I disagree. The only time I could see their complaints is when you're in a room with no lights on and then you can kind of see what's on the screen. Other than that if you're in your house or an office or outside, you can see the screen unless you're looking straight on the phone. Maybe others have had a problem because their screen brightness is turned up too high. The only complaint I have is the cut out at the top for the ear piece and camera is a little off center. But that doesn't affect the the phone in any way.
0.69403124	0.69689476	"My wife ordered these for her iPhone 5. She asked me to help put it on, but of course I was like ""No way! If I mess up on this, you will kill me!"". As you can see, I'm still alive...so that means we put it on successfully!There are 3 protectors in the package. This means you have 3 chances to get it right. I recommend following the directions 100%. Also, I recommend applying them in the cleanest room in your house or at a friend's house that has a clean room. The longer you take to apply the film, the more likely it will be that debris attach to the back of it, so the faster you do it, the better. Of course, that also increases your chance of misaligning it too.The package comes with everything you need. A cloth to wipe with, the protectors themselves, instructions, and a card to help get rid of bubbles. There's even a video on their website that shows someone applying one of these to their device.For my wife's phone, we bought a Otterbox Defender case. This comes with its own screen protector. Guess what though? Otterbox screen protectors are awful! Debris do get through and so does moisture -- which creates the annoying RAINBOW effect. The best solution? Remove their screen protector and instead apply one of these bad boys! Alternatively, you could just use two screen protectors. Either way, you'll want one of these.So would I buy this product again? Yes, I most certainly would!"
0.90605414	0.8428581	This screen protector is great for the price of $5. You get three of them to install just in case you mess up. It fits perfectly on my iPhone 5, and having a Speck Candyshell Grip case, there's no bunching or bubbles. It does a good job with glare and finger prints. The only knock is that when there's a white background you can see the dots with that look grainy but if you put an anti-glare/fingerprint screen protector you should expect that. Besides that, the screen quality is pretty good and I'd say the clarity for the retina display is 90-95% with the screen protector on. I'm still waiting for the Power Support HD Anti-glare Screen protector because I read that you get less of the dots/grainy look on white backgrounds and it allows more light through the screen protector.
0.9918958000000001	0.9184152	I choose this screen protector after reading countless descriptions and reviews. I was impressed by this company's desire to reach out to customers and assist with their problems and concerns.I received the pack of 3 screen protectors, a polishing cloth, a cardboard &#34;squeegee&#34;, and dust removal tape today and got to work.  I have never installed a screen protector myself on any of my smart phones or iPods.  They were always applied by my wife or a person at the phone store.  Basically, I am a rookie.This is a simple process if u follow these few tips:1. Do this in a clean room (no pets) on a clean, bare table.2. Wipe the phone down with the cloth, only touching the sides of the phone.3. Use the tape to remove any dust.4. Peel back about 1 inch and align it around the button. Lay the rest down to check alignment with the top of phone (speaker).5. Throw away the squeegee and pull out a credit card. The squeegee falls apart and pieces can get stuck under product.6. Use the card to slide backwards on the top of protector as u peel off the backing.7. Use the card to work out any air bubbles towards the closest edge.8. Peel off the top sheet and you are good to go!This appears to be a high quality protector and for someone who has never applied one of these before, the process was quite quick and easy for the 2 phones I did! Got them both on the first try.I'm not sure how some people had such a difficult time applying their protectors, but I recommend trying my steps listed above and most importantly, do it in a clean environment.I highly recommend this product and will definitely purchase from this company again!
0.9738902	0.7722286	I really like this, easy to install, cut well, and functional.  My only slight reduction in rating is for clarity.  It does reduce the clarity very slightly so I had to increase the brightness a lite on my iPhone 5.
0.90788203	0.7563696	I couldn't believe how easy it was to apply it.  I started by cleaning the iPhone 5 screen with premoistened Lens Cleaning Tissues that I use to clean my glasses. I also used the included lint cloth to remove all dust specs.  Next applied the screen protector as instructed, and it was done! No dust specs, no bubbles, and you cannot even tell that the screen protector was there.  I tested by using the iPhone and was surprised how well the touch screen was responding. The screen looked crisp and clean and worked perfect!  I am uploading a photo for you to see.  Thank you Tech Armor!Note: The package also includes a dust pick up tape but I did not need to use that.  It also has a large plastic card to chase the bubbles out.  I only used that briefly since I only had a couple of bubbles at the edges.
0.9962228000000001	0.8521571	Before I even received the package Tech Armor emailed detailed instructions for applying the screen protector to my phone.  The protector went on flawless with no air bubbles and looks great on the phone.
0.9938306999999998	0.7454997	It's a real pleasure when a transaction works as promised. The product arrived in the time promised and in perfect condition. The packaging was excellent.I didn't realize when I ordered these iPhone screen protector that they're the same ones I had on my last phone. They worked wonderfully and I had no screen damage in 3 years.
0.9975002000000001	0.7847949000000001	works great easy to install no bubbles came with a good tip sheet for installation great value for the price
0.98745966	0.8756166999999999	I was concerned about getting a screen protector for my iPhone 5, because I didn't want the beautiful retina display to look tingy or faded. Well, I am glad that I purchased the HD screen protectors from Tech Armor. There is literally no difference in resolution quality between no screen protector, and having on of these HD screen protectors on there. The directions inside the package made installing the screen protector a breeze. They seem to be pretty durable too, after about a week no scratches! The only negative, which is to be expected is that you can see fingerprints. That's kind of the trade-off, either you keep the high resolution look or dim the screen with anti-fingerprint. Either way you choose Tech Armor has you covered, they make an anti-fingerprint model as well. I would recommend this product.
0.99788785	0.8564056999999999	These Tech Armor iphone screen protectors worked great. They fit the phone perfectly and I haven't had any problems with them.
0.55905086	0.53927046	Don't know if mine was defective or not, but there was definitely a bit of distance between the holes in the protector and the speaker/camera of my phone. Other than that, service was quick and the product arrives brand new and sealed. Nothing to complain about.
0.9545360999999999	0.77877903	These work really well if you get them on correctly.  They are a little tricky and easy to go through all 3 trying to get it on right.
0.9728606	0.7779545999999999	I really like this screen protector, because it's much more durable than other brands I have tried. The Tech Armor screen protector makes it much easier to swipe on the iPhone. Also, it really does defend against scratches better than other brands.
0.9864171999999999	0.7316876999999999	This screen protector was worth my money. The anti glare was a hit! Easy to clean and attach to my iPhone. Would recommend this product and the company
0.8416103000000001	0.7814076	"I wasn't sure what to expect with the ""anti-glare"" and ""anti-fingerprint"" properties. But I actually really like how it looks and it actually does work! I find my phone actually a little more responsive when I swipe with my fingers, compared to the bare screen. It was also pretty easy to put on. I maight just have got lucky though, but one try did it for me. I would definitely recommend it."
0.9957652	0.85210943	Great product! The screen protector went on easily the first time. Screen is clear and doesn't interfere with picture quality or touch screen. Super fast shipping!
0.9655011999999998	0.7849649000000001	I am a neatnick and wanted a no fingerprint/no glare protection for my new iphone 5.  I went to Amazon, read the reviews and then got the Tech Armor.  When I got the product I did everything they suggested.  I went to their website, looked at the video and did what they told me.  I also used suggestions from reviews I had read.  I went in the bathroom, turned on the shower until there was steam in the room and then applied the shield. I got it on with just a minor adjustment. It has been on my phone for about a month now and it is absolutely perfect.  NO PRINTS and NO GLARE. It was a three pack so I have 2 more!! You will love it!
0.9620656999999999	0.7852281	"I want to point out the protector's layout has been updated since some reviews - the home button is fully surrounded by a circle of protector now (not the ""u"" shaped design that earlier reviewers mention). I wouldn't think this would matter, but this small detail makes it so much easier to line up and apply correctly. And my old Z*** brand protector had the U design and it began to lift up from the phone at the U spot because the other brand protector's points made it vulnerable to catch on stuff.When I bought my phone the store recommended Z*** brand so I had their HD version on my white phone. Gradually the other brand absorbed dirt into the proctor and looked filthy even after I gently washed it off, so I obviously needed a new protector fast! Love that Tech Armor is a Prime eligible item!Bought Tech Armor's matte version to replace the dirty Z-brand one and am thrilled with the results. Such a difference!I have applied protectors before and have had the best luck with this one. Watching the video as recommended is key. I followed Tech Armor's instructions and was able to apply my proctor correctly and without any dust or bubbles lodged in, all on the FIRST TRY!! So watch the videos  & note how they wipe the screen clean by wiping the cloth in the same direction.My phone's screen looks so much nicer, I need to buy a new case now."
0.01411882	0.6406646	Disappointed with this product.  There is no elongated ear piece hole at the top to incorporate the sensor.  Wouldn't buy this product until they update their design.
0.9741017	0.6986234	I did not want to deal with the wet protectors. These are amazing for the price. Very pleased. I took them to the AT&T store and made them put it on for me, which they were happy to do even though they don't carry this brand. They are, after all, skilled professionals.
0.09780049	0.41409266	I normally buy the power support brand but it seems for the 5 they have raised the price. I bought this one because of the good reviews but I was unhappy with how grainy it made the screen look. The biggest issue for me was that the cutouts for the camera and speaker were not centered on all 3 of the films.
0.93144894	0.69844913	It works perfectly fine. People are saying it is hard to apply but i think it is very easy to apply, took me less than 2 mins.
0.74598527	0.6759291000000001	The screen protector arrived on time. The big advantage is that it is really easy to use. But it makes the screen looks not really clear after applying the product. Overall, the product is good!
0.9683305	0.5986056	I like they include cleaning sheet and card to take bubles out.  Less glare and good protection.  I love it.
0.75530493	0.7311255999999999	The screen protector works good so far when on...but since they are cut out to go around your speaker, camera and home button perfectly...I wasted 2 screen protectors trying to get them on...I either got the home button covered great and the camera was covered...or I got the camera great and the home button was covered...so with all the constant peeling on and off by the time it was on it was dirty and needed another...thankfully the 3rd protector went on acceptable...bad thing is I bought 2 packs at once...
0.5966134	0.8251755	
0.96885276	0.79599977	I have probably tried 4 or 5 different screen protectors over the years as I upgrade my iPhone or scratch up old ones.  This is my favorite so far.  The anti-glare finish does give it somewhat of a matte appearance, but the colors are still vivid and text is very clear.
0.9846121999999999	0.81222105	if you put it on correctly (align it with the sides, make sure it's perfectly around the home button, and have no air bubbles) then it's like you don't even have a screen protector and let me tell yah, you sometimes forget it's even there! it's great, the screen keeps its quality and everything!
0.09902686	0.5073723	The screen protector is anti-glare, to some extent anti-fingerprint, and very bad for screen quality. With this screen protector, the screen looks low-resolution and noisy.
0.97742593	0.6975125	I have these for my S3 as well. TechArmor support is great, I contacted them multiple times to get replacements, always get them fast.
0.9972004999999999	0.6864326	I love this screen saver. I don't see any fingerprint smudges which is great. There is no glare and I love it. Great price, great product.
0.78103745	0.69636285	It was good while it lasted. My battery drained quick which was expected because the film is so dark that your screen brightness needs to be on blast, but overall it served me well. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that it lifted off the screen so easily. It also made the screen a little blurry and things weren't so easy to read. It's a decent privacy cover. I can't say it wasn't worth the money. It was a good deal.
0.93898606	0.7723061	If your annoyed with fingerprints all over your screen this is for you, its easy to apply and reduces glare.
0.97261304	0.80840373	I love the matte finish.  My old screen protector was glossy and it gave off a glare making it hard to read the screen at times.  I have had several people ask me why the finish on my phone looks non-glossy so I recommend them to this product!
0.8780780999999999	0.5797359000000001	The best thing about this screen protector was the tool they sent with it to help apply it th the phone.
0.9768565999999999	0.78787416	This is a great screen protecter. I applied it with no bubbles on the screen part and a couple off the screen. The holes for the home button, camera, speaker, etc. are all exactly where they should be. The case looks great on my white iPhone 5.
0.8879663000000001	0.8141525	As beautiful as a shiny new screen is on any new Apple product, I simply cannot stand the buildup of fingerprints. I know I could easily wipe it off...but why wipe it off when I can avoid fingerprints all together? Now this screen protector isn't perfect, and when my fingers are extra oily for whatever reason (that sounds gross, but hey it happens), you might see some smudges on it. At the end of the day, though, this screen protector leaves it looking pretty darn clean. Also love the feel of the matte finish, and I prefer this over the feeling of a bare screen or a shiny screen protector.My only grip about this protector, and all other matte screen protectors, for that matter, is that there is a bit of a &#34;rainbow effect&#34;, especially noticeable on lighter colors. It's hard to explain, but it is something I've gotten used to. I've previously used a matte Zagg Invisishield, and I must say, this screen protector was not nearly as bad as that.All in all, I have been very pleased with this screen protector, and I would never go back to a normal one again!PRO'S- greatly reduced fingerprints- no glare- smooth as butter feelCON'S- &#34;rainbow effect&#34; (standard for matte protectors)- gunks up around the edges, like any screen protector
0.3318357	0.7046142	This reduces the finger prints that are caused at the cost of cutting the clarity to some extent which I guess all the matt screen protectors would do. I am really happy with the product as I dont care much about the clarity. You feel good when you move the fingers over the screen protector, there is no resistance to do so. I am still using the first one, if I run of all 3 then I will go ahead and buy this again.
0.65465724	0.73135567	If you dont have these you are missing out, super sensitive and durable able to put phone in rough areas and still no scratches on the screen, this is a must have!
0.8946973	0.5873584	So far so good. It was easy to it on and helps with glare nicely. Not sure if it will scratch, but I have 2 more if it does.
0.994239	0.83929205	I was very impressed.  Have never been able to get a screen protector on any of my products until this one.  Very clear and precise instructions as well as all the quality tools I needed for installation were included in the kit.  I followed the instructions and even though I had a couple of pieces of lint on the screen I was able to remove them and get a perfect installation of the screen protector.  I would highly recommend Tech Armor to everyone.  Not to mention that they totally stand behind their product.  I didn't have to give them a call, but if I did, I would have confidence in their support.
0.9936007	0.8080769	"""Great product and value. Had everything you needed and proper directions to install easily. Don't spend $20 $30 on a screen protector peeps. Get this!"""
0.025937706	0.31404227	This is the worst screen protector I have ever come across. I have used multiple screen protectors on my phones in the past, but this one stands out as the worst. It developed so many air bubbles that my friends could notice it from a distance.
0.9953263000000001	0.834053	The Tech Armor screen protector is by far and away the best screen protector out there with easy application and great fit with a case by diztronic for iPhone 5
0.8395517	0.72011876	A little tricky keeping dust off while putting it on. Even a little speck of dust will create a bubble.
0.36068672	0.7308114	The privacy screen still requires a fairly high degree of angle to create true privacy.  When viewed straight on, the image looks blurry because of the way the protector is made, so it is is necessary to hold the phone slightly angled away to get the best view.  Overall, not convinced that the lost viewability justifies the low degree of increased privacy.
0.96732575	0.71325374	Liked the lifetime warranty.  Just received my replacement screen protectors.  I used up my initial ones and emailed them and they sent the replacement right away.Thanks
0.9633242	0.7549618	Great screen protector for my iphone5... I only have one gripe that it covers the camera lens on the front of the phone, but it hasn't been a problem yet.  It was VERY easy to put on and comes with lots of little helpers to keep it clean!
0.9965282	0.87483734	I picked this protector out of all the others on the market based on the reviews of both the product and the customer service, knowing I'd be in good hands.  The instructions were easy to follow and I applied the protectors to both my phone and my wife's phone on the first try, and in less than 5 minutes.  You can't even tell it's there, either by sight or touch.  Simply awesome.
0.82119906	0.81224096	This is the first time I've ever had a screen protector that it was possible to take off and reapply if you don't get it right the first time! Though it is difficult to line up at first (you HAVE to go by the top camera and speaker button basically), it is very easy to apply. It does what it says- there is no glare in bright light, and fingerprints don't show up, and if they do they wipe away instantly. If you're looking for great, cheap screen protectors, these are the way to go. Tech Armor will now be who I go to first for future protectors.
0.82126343	0.7694217	I really like that this protector has a matte anti-glare finish. Not only does it help with using my phone in sunlight, or as a GPS in the car, but it also has a nice feel to it, and shows no fingerprints.
0.99114937	0.79420626	I really liked the fact that they included a &#34;dust removal&#34; strip and gave very good and easy to understand tips for applying the screen protector.  I'm very happy with this product, and just prefer the matte over the clear.
0.5391568	0.61348146	They're a little challenging to apply, and take a day to get the stickiness off of them.One problem is that I was messing with my case (Otterbox commuter) and accidentally ripped the bottom of my first one (just with my finger)The good news is that it came with 3!
0.9849752	0.7921244000000001	This product was easy to install and works as described.  I didn't have any problems with it except the usual trying to keep dust out between the Iphone screen and the protector.  Fits perfectly.
0.07480666	0.5647184000000001	I promptly received my screen covers and 2 out of 6 were defective.  I tried going to the tech armor website and filling out the form.  But I was told that my order number from amazon was incorrect.  I contacted Tech Armor customer service a week ago and have not heard back from them at all.If you are going to buy these screen protectors.  Buy them and ignore the fact that they are suppose to have a warranty.Update 1/3/13I have moved my rating form 1 star to 3.Tech Armor customer service finally got back to me A WEEK LATER by email.  There is no phone number to contact them and slow customer service....
0.8082775	0.7523814	It's cheap, the first one went on just fine (meaning I have 2 spares), it doesn't seem to scratch as easily as other cheap screen protectors, and the fit is fine. It also works with my slim case I bought. It's exactly what I was looking for.
0.7712287	0.66493034	...I'm just glad they put three in a pack, because apparently, third time was a charm.  Still, for the amount I paid versus what they tried to charge me in the store, I will keep coming back here for more.
0.14011600000000002	0.60379356	It's cheap and ok. Minor bubble repeatedly show on top corner after a few weeks of use. It's cheap enough and comes with 3 them so no complain there.
0.99516344	0.76251256	Very easy to install and works well, very clear and doesn't look like there is one on the phone, just works awesome...and the price is right!!
0.9820909999999999	0.5660829	I order this product and when I received I am fully satisfied with the product.  I will recommend this product to others too.  Fast delivery came in before time.
0.96520656	0.68261015	Nice product works as advertised. I am using it and it serving the purpose. I would recommend it for anyone with iPhone 5.
0.9164984	0.53068286	It is as good as more expensive products if not better. The packaging is great and arrived on time. I will definitely buy it again if needed.
0.7538705	0.57323456	Honestly I was doubting the review on here but this matte screen is pretty good. Everything is visible and clear. none of that rainbow stuff involved. Thanks!
0.88673174	0.7403192	I had no problem installing and the anti glare works.  Just be aware that it is a matte finish so it does take away the glass crispness of the screen.
0.9982635	0.8259938	Very nice screen protectors...better than another brand that is highly advertised.Great directions; easy to apply to my phone.  There is even a video to watch for help!
0.99244845	0.8138621	Love these protectors.  They do all they say and amazingly don't cut down on any of the screen resolution.  Definitely recommend!
0.9903264	0.6788062	Very happy with product. Easy to apply and no bubbles as I have had with other products. I would purchase this product again. Fast service also.
0.6584960999999999	0.73481995	Seller sent this to me very quickly and it was as promised. It works very well for privacy, but there is no doubt that it is very dark when you look at it. The item itself is easy to apply and well made.
0.9934181000000001	0.7966038000000001	Works great with the phone!  Screen is nice and clear and definitely protected!  Just make sure you read the directions carefully!  I was distracted and messed up one of the covers so I had to throw away and use another one.
0.98364675	0.78176755	I love these screen protectors. I like the anti glare. These are the first anti glare protectors I've  ever used and I think this is all ill use from now on.
0.7186357	0.72961634	"Updated on  1/10/14: I have replaced the key-scratched screen protector with another one that came with the package (there's a total of 3 in each pack).  I noticed that the actual glass screen of my iphone5 has been unscratched and undamaged. On that regard, I have improved my rating to 4 stars. However, I couldn't get 4 teeny tiny air bubbles out while I was installing it, and it's still there even days after installation. Nevertheless, the protector is still doing its job, and it doesn't affect my screen viewing & the phone's touch sensitivity is still the same as if I didn't have the screen protector on.  This item works well with my Otterbox Commuter series case.  It will not peel off on the sides; it's actually neatly tucked under the case, as if I didn't have a protector.Original post:Maybe I was expecting too much from a screen protector, but this was easily ""scratched"" when I put the phone in the pocket where my keys were.  The keys made minor scratches with bumps.  That mark was distracting from that point on.  However, the package does come with 3 screen protectors, so I replaced it.  I used the little cardboard that came with the package to ""squeegee"" out the bubbles, but it left the protector with very shallow scratch marks, only visible if seen through the side (15-degree angle to the screen).  The scratches do not affect the viewing of the phone and its apps."
0.9850341999999999	0.7443148	first time I applied they were perfect and NO bubbles or dust were underneathmy favorite of all ones I tried
0.98072565	0.79051733	I bought this for my very picky 16 year old to use on her new iphone 5s.  She likes the anti-glare and says that it works fine.  It does take some time to learn to put it on perfectly without bubbles and dust but once its on, it looks great.  I suggest you review the videos of how to put it on.
0.28072990000000003	0.36939418	You mess up once and you have to use a new strip. Really bad for installing. bad bad bad bad
0.9703345999999999	0.7981107	No bubbles, very easy install, great quality! Was very easy to install..actually it set me up...when I went to install my husbands screen protector using ANOTHER brand, I thought I did something wrong. That wasn't the case...there's a big difference in quality with screen protectors. I wish Tech Armor made a protectors for Pantech Flex because I would have bought for my husbands phone as well!
0.9800334999999999	0.8310429	These screen protectors are of really good quality. There's almost no glare whatsoever and they are very easy to install. Just make sure you clean the screen with the cloth to make sure you don't get air bubbles!
0.8227661000000001	0.70362264	Feels like I don't have a screen protector on at all but in the end it didn't line up perfectly with phone itself.  Good for the $ value but maybe worth getting a more expensive product to fit perfectly.
0.7561893	0.67665106	I got these 3 screen protector because I wanted to change, I always use the type you need to wet the phone, so for a change this product is a good choice, I have it on my phone right now and looks very clean and have this feeling just like if there was no protector. it is a great buy honestly, you go to regular stores and you end up paying way too much and you get cheap stuff that just work for few weeks, this protector looks clean, and expensive but you only pay so little.
0.9989691999999999	0.8173889	I have had this on my iPhone for about a month now and they are perfect.  You can barley tell they are on your screen they are so clear and awesome!  Protects phone and looks totally invisible.  That's a win / win in my book!
0.9454290999999999	0.6822636999999999	Item ordered was the Tech Armor Iphone 5 HD screen protector.Prompt, friendly, and helpful customer service at Tech Armor. Delivered exactly on time, however, I made a mistake in the shipping address of my order. Had contacted Amazon and USPS customer support and they didn't respond.So I emailed TA customer support. They responded almost immediately, and were very helpful. I realized my mistake and everything was resolved. Great product as well-Apply it correctly and you don't even know it's there.
0.99033535	0.75253564	I love it. I covers your whole screen and it comes with everything you need to put the cover on without bubbles.
0.99097025	0.7878477	It went on really easy. I read everyone's reviews and went in the bathroom after steaming it up with a hot shower. I have no complaints.
0.22812772	0.64867187	In the past I have always used the screen protectors from Zagg without issue. I thought I would try these out with my new iphone and have found that they are not as good. The packaging, instructions and included installation tools worked well but the protector itself has lasted about a week. There is now significant scratching on the surface of the protector from being in my jeans pocket all day. It is to the point that the image has become hazy and when the screen is off you can see scratches across most of the surface.This product might be fine in a purse but it does not hold up to active use. I will end up replacing this with the Zagg protector when it is too hazy to read through.
0.6199756999999999	0.77481985	The matte finish is much nicer than the mirror shiny, which reflects light and obscures the images on the iPhone.  It has a life-time warranty, does not show fingerprints, and is easy to keep clean with the included special cloth.
0.6771235999999999	0.6520252	"Seems to be holding up just fine so far though I'm guessing the two ""spare"" protectors are going to come in handy at some point. I can already see a couple of places where the protector didn't quite adhere to the phone's screen.Shipping was fast. I'd buy from this seller again."
0.8334421999999999	0.71834546	Great product.  Difficult to install.  Definitely try the steamy bathroom trick to avoid dust.  Also, other install directions are not the easiest way to install.  Recommend pulling backing off completely, bending side to side and lining up camera/speaker and bottom button (stick down the middle first).
0.9899766999999999	0.71771985	Product is exactly as claimed - no glare, no prints. I am so glad I purchased this item! Thank you, Mp
0.99950063	0.9240149999999999	I have been using this Tech Armor Screen Protector for about 1 week now. All I can say is it is fantastic! When I first bought my iPhone 5 I immediately knew I needed to protect the display with something. So at my time of purchase the store employee at RS convinced me that theZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Apple iPhone 5 - Smudge Proof Case Friendly Screenwas the way to go. So I decided to go ahead and get it. I am not a fan of Zagg screen protectors primarily because of the ridiculous price they charge in brick and mortar stores. This is my first iPhone. I came from an HTC EVO 4G running Android. I never had a Retina display before and the Zagg Smudge proof protector that I had installed before I even used the iPhone once ruined the clear display that the iPhone 5 has. I had no idea of course since last week when I removed the Zagg and installed this Tech Armor. I mean the difference in clarity is night and day. The text is sharp and the images are brighter than with the Zagg Smudge Proof one. I was shocked when I first installed the Tech Armor. I could not believe that for over a month I was ruining my first experience with a retina display iPhone.Installation was easy. No bubbles, no dust caught underneath it, just an easy installation. I did not have to spray the screen with any liquids either (other than to clean it first). If you have never installed a screen protector on a mobile device before you will find that with the Tech Armor it is very easy and it fits perfectly. The cut outs are perfectly lined up the way it should be. I also use an Incipio Case bought here on Amazon and the Tech Armor did not cause any problems when putting the 2 piece Incipio case on. I have theIncipio Dual PRO for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Obsidian Black/ Obsidian Blackwhich I highly recommend. It comes in a variety of colors as well. I plan on getting the Tech Armor Screen protectors for my iPad 2 as well as my new iPad Mini. You can not and will not go wrong with these screen protector. I used a variety of different brands on my HTC EVO 4G over the 2 + years I owned it and by far the Tech Armor is the best.
0.9965229	0.7726916	Always use these screen protectors and always had the best results and keeps the phone in the best shape possible! And I can see outside without any issues! Well done! :)
0.9768839	0.6716913	This screen protector will help keep those nosy people out of your business because they won't be able to see your screen at all. Plus it gives you some great protection from all those ways you could scratch your screen.
0.74821866	0.5687424	These screen protectors are easy to install but show fingerprints which I find annoying. I'l continue to use them, but I will look for an alternative in the future.
0.98411906	0.78067815	Nice fit, works for me. Goes well with my wife's case and it serve its purpose well. No peeling and very easy to put on
0.43588522	0.6093705	My friend recently got a privacy screen protector recently, and I thought I'd give it a try. His made the screen completely impossible to see unless you were looking straight on. This Tech Armor one, however, only blurs things a little. You can still make out shapes and images, and very easily see the time on the screen, from any direction.It really does little more than blur the image slightly.
0.6448915	0.66725177	Installation went great till I had to remove tab 2.  It should have peeled right off a la the instruction video, but it was stuck like glue.  I had to gently rub it off in pieces like an old-fashioned price tag.  It left a sticky residue, which I gingerly removed with tiny dabs of plastic-safe Goo Gone on my screen-cleaning cloth (not the one that came with the product).  Thankfully, I knew which goo-remover to use -- NEVER use a plastic melter like Goof Off!  Be careful not to let your cleaning swipes leave the protective film.  I suspect a plastic-friendly cleaner would be OK on your precious phone, but don't take chances.I was unable to remove a small bubble on the edge of the protector but no big deal as it doesn't interfere with what's displayed.  Just as advertised, my screen is still crystal clear and entirely touch sensitive.  I suspect the tab 2 stickiness was an anomaly since tab 1 peeled right off.  It's a survivable problem if you know what to do...and now you do 'cause I've told you how! If and when I need to replace my current protector, I'll test the stickiness of both tabs before I proceed.
0.97361803	0.67567635	My other phone has Gorilla Glass on it, so I don't worry, but I have heard about iphone screens cracking.  I wanted to protect it.  This fits perfectly, I had no trouble applying it (I was careful), and I mostly don't even know it is there!  Exactly what I expected.  I don't have any trouble with bubbles like some commentors had, but I made sure the glass was super clean before I applied it, and washed my hands before I started, too.
0.90072143	0.56320566	There are many good and detailed reviews available, but the reason i am writing this is because I found it to be simple. I am always faced with this problem of applying screens to my devices correctly and without bubbles. I took a lot of time preapring this time too as I am too clumsy to apply without a glitch. Only differnce was that I am using this product. I was sure to get a bubble this time as always. As soon as I put it from bottom to top, it stuck itself to the screen without bubbles. I didn't even have to press a bubble out. I wonder why companies like Apple don't come with a screen applied first time but for someone like me a product like this helps.
0.9956712	0.8522677	Cover works exactly as advertised. Was easy to install and continues to show no sign of wear while still protecting my screen.
0.4157663	0.5255884	This was incredibly easy to install, and their method of removing dust from underneath the screen protector is so simple yet brilliant.  After installation, the screen protector is barely visible and integrates easily with the iphone.  I spent twice as much money and installation time on the Skinomi TechSkin (which was a HORRIBLE product).  I wish I went with Tech Armor to begin with but I got caught up in the hype and fancy packaging of the Skinomi.
0.8404427999999999	0.5162234	Fit perfectly, go on easy to my Iphone 5. I hate that I don't get these plastic things for free from Apple but hey at least I got the best cheap alternative that comes in a pack of 3.
0.99416476	0.68301237	Absolutely love the screen.  Easy to apply and so crystal clear.  There are also a how to instruction if you need help.
0.9841241	0.79629487	This is such a great screen protector. I am not a fan of the no glare ones so I wanted to find something that would make the screen look just as great as it does with out a protector on it and this is it. The screen is just as crisp and clear as if there were no screen protector! Amazing!
0.99114424	0.76787186	Protects and doesn't have any glare.  Easy to apply and sticks well. Does the job. Would order again. Good protector so far.
0.9421029000000001	0.75334364	"we got this with the ""buy this case, get 50% off screen protector""..  good quality, you get 3 screen protectors, and at that promo price you cant get any other better deal. thanks!"
0.6354689	0.5781264	pretty cool! it's my first iphone so im new to this but after one botched attempt the second one came out decent. beware of dust particles to avoid bubbling. I only have 3 small ones but I still have one screen protector left. all in all it's good
0.016304463	0.52295357	It would not fit properly on Iphone 5. Bubbles could not be avoided. Also, it peeled constantly. Very thin. Prefer Zagg with which have had no problems.
0.90573823	0.8243474000000001	I was skeptical that this was going to work.  But, I have to say that I am very pleased to say that it does work.  Unless someone is staring straight on at your phone, then it does block their view of what is going on with your phone.  That said, it does not completely black out your phone screen- and it's not supposed to (you still need to have some visibility); I've yet to find a phone or computer privacy screen that does that. I find using this privacy screen really helpful and it does keep nosey people staring at your phone at work, school or any other random place from seeing what is going on.  It also makes it more difficult to see at a distance even if someone is standing/sitting in proximity and may have a slightly better view of the front of your screen.I have to admit though that I didn't affix it to my phone, my husband did- but as I watched it took all of a few minutes and I have not had any issues with keeping it adhered to my phone or any bubbles or things like that.  This is definitely a good buy.
0.108061165	0.47201940000000003	I both this thinking that if they offer life time warranty the product should be good. WRONG!! The cut was not accurate with with phone. If a leave the the camera uncover then I have some extra around the edges. The corner start comming up and got damage a week after I installed. I won't even bother to get a replacement!
0.99428165	0.7930433000000001	Product is just as described. Easy to install and matte look looks great on iphone 5! Gives it a different look!
0.99702096	0.7859837	Screen protectors are a must so you need to find one that is easy to apply.  This one is pretty easy to apply and it works well, so no complaints.
0.9281553	0.79932344	After reading the reviews I was fairly certain that this was a worthwhile purchase and I was correct.  As described in other reviews and by the company themselves, it does degrade the resolution of the screen slightly.  After having it on there for some time I don't even notice it though.  Overall, it was very easy to install and I was able to do mine and my wife's on the first try without incident.  No bubbles at all using it as described.  The upside of the antiglare is that it does indeed reduce glare and i don't notice any finger prints at all.  If the crispect resolution if a must, this may not be for you, but otherwise, I am very happy with it.  if they could manage to make it antiglare and fingerprint-proof and maintain the resolution it would be perfect, but I am sure that is next to impossible.
0.99931335	0.8703419	Excellent purchase. It is better than I imagined. Even my bf who was hesitant about putting any type of screen protection on his phone asked me for a sheet.  The screen quality is way awesome! Just have patience when installing it and make sure you clean screen perfectly well. Small particles manage to stay on the screen which can mess up the installation.
0.07837224	0.48310859999999994	I have installed multiple screen protectors to my iPhone and other products with very minimal issues. This product was by far the worst. I made sure there was no dust or particles on my screen, but still had serious problems getting it bubble free. Most of the protectors have two removable sides that help to prevent scratches when installing, this did not. I am very disappointed and frustrated with this product.
0.8463733	0.74784553	I am happy with the screen protector for the price.  It's probably not the best one you can get, but it works well, it went on with very few bubbles, and it does the job.  You can see fingerprints and smudges really well, so if you care about that maybe invest in something a bit higher quality.
0.9566946	0.81340134	It fit perfect, no bubbles, not even with a cover, Love the anti- fingerprint / glare feature too. I can't tell it's there
0.0012312830000000001	0.40062827	Don't waste your money. Does not work as advertised. Going to request a return very shortly. So save your money!!
0.9316549000000001	0.7885058000000001	I ordered this screen protector for my husband's new iPhone 5.  It was easy to put on, but I put it on crooked the first time, so thankfully they included 3!  It looks SO good on his phone!  You can barely tell it is there and my husband loves it.  In the past, he has had such a hard time with screen protectors.  They either peel up at the sides, don't fit well with his case, or start to flake off after time.  Even though we've only had this a short time, I can tell the quality is SOOOO much better than the others we have bought in the store.  Not only did we pay WAY less, we got a better product.  The shipping was very fast!  You really cannot beat this product, we will never buy a different kind again!
0.78214645	0.67029333	I like the screen protector and think it will work great.  My only small complaint is that the hole for the speaker is a little off center.  It still fits, but it leaves a good bit exposed to the left of the speaker.  It's not a big enough deal to make me return it or dislike it.  Had the hole been perfectly centered, I'd have given it 5 stars.
0.99356556	0.81311	I just purchased screen protectors by Tech Armor for my iPhone5 from Amazon and the process went smoothly! The product arrived on time and as advertised. The screen protectors came with instructions for installation and were easy to install. I would purchase this product from Amazon again.
0.91819775	0.5947226	Be sure to use the tape when applying, it will help in not getting any fibers, lint or hair off your screen, before applying.  All in all a great product. I only took one star off for application ease (it is not really that simple), yet an excellant product.
0.104275525	0.38452357	I gave it two stars because I had troubles installing the screen protector. I watched the video several times and followed the directions, but I kept ending up with hundred of bubbles. On the third try I realized that the stickers were backwards and I was applying the top of the protector to my iphone screen. I flipped it over once I realized that and spent the next 20 minutes carefully removing all the dust. It seems like it would be a good cover if I had installed it correctly the first time. However through the process I wasted two protectors and poorly installed the third.
0.15552437	0.50290674	Well, I struggled to put it on as it was my first time to do it myself as dust specks kept showing up and ended up using all of the three films but I managed to put the last one on with ZERO dust or air bubbles. It offers full coverage of the screen without unnecessary openings as it completely fits. You won't feel it nor see it.
0.9986856	0.87169844	Unlike other screen protectors that I have had this one works the best! There are no bubbles on the screen and installing it on my phone was fast and easy. Everything is included! They included a screen cleaner, a tool to help instal the screen without bubbles. The picture on my screen didn't change when I placed the protector on my screen. IHighly satisfied with this product and would buy this product again.
0.9940474	0.8808286	Great value -- 3 protectors included.  Watched the video on the company's website so I would know how to put the screen protector on, and it went on perfectly!  Comes with cleaning cloth and stiff card to help push out any air bubbles. Basically the screen protector is sandwiched between 2 clear protective sheets so that you do not scratch the screen protector when you are applying it and getting out any air bubbles.  Once the protector is applied and any air bubbles removed, the second sheet comes off the top by pulling up on the second tab. Watch the video.  It helps and prevents you from applying the protector incorrectly and ruining it.  Also, it fits the Iphone 5 perfectly!
0.994986	0.71190345	Items were shipped promptly and were in excellent condition.  The iPhone cover was exactly what I was looking for.  Everything was as I expected except that I received the items quicker than anticipated.
0.042584687	0.66531825	Me and my wife both had these on our iPhone 4s and loved it. Unfortunately this one does not provide near as much privacy as the old ones did. I am disappointed in this filter, all it seems to do it make the screen dimmer, but it is still easily read form the sides.
0.9998123	0.8388479	Works great.  Easy to apply and fits perfectly.  Easy to remove air bubbles.  Squeegee came in handy.  Would definitely recommend.
0.9347841	0.661277	I put this on and forgot it was there. Clear and good. No scratches, no nothing, it works like it should.
0.907797	0.5918174	This was a bit tricky to apply at first, but they give you 3. It's not perfect, but the tiny bubbles are not noticeable. It protects my phone which is the most important thing. I will note that I emailed the company for replacement and they said they would mail me a package, but I have yet to recieve it....??
0.9975122	0.87926745	I was skeptical to buy this at first since it was a fraction of the price of some of the other reputable brands, but decided to take a chance. Glad I did. My husband paid $30 for his Zagg HD screen protector and it was harder to put on, peels easily and does not look as seamless as the Tech Armor cover. We compared screen to screen and mine actually appears a bit clearer and it is not even evident that there is a cover on it! Very satisfied with this product.
0.984353	0.8535072	The iphone 5 screen protector by Tech Armor FITS. i have tried a couple of other covers on iphones and the things always covered a few parts. This screen goes on super easy and no bubbles for me. i wondered if that is because it seems a little thicker than other screens, but even with that it cause no problems with performance of the phone or how it fits in my case. it also is the best when trying to look at your phone in the sunlight. it came with 3 screens but i am still on the first one gave the others to my two granddaughters and even they are impressed.
0.99347377	0.86154246	I am very happy with the Tech Armor iphone 5 screen protector. It is easy to apply and there are no bubbles! Much much better than the overpriced, hard to apply, and easy to get bubbles Zagg protectors that I used before.
0.83767664	0.71577096	I usually don't care for phone covers because they feel plasticky and fake. I really like the feel of Apple's glass. If you feel the same way, this is definitely the screen protector for you. Great feel and thin. You hardly notice it's there until you look at the edges. I've gotten 3 or 4 different kinds of screen protectors for my iPhones over the years and this is definitely my favorite.My only complaint is that the cutouts for the telephone speaker and front-facing camera are not centered, but I'm not even sure if there is light-sensing equipment under there that requires it be offset...
0.84758097	0.57976586	I am not too satisfied with this screen protector. Since it is mat finish, doesn't look nice in iPhone 5. Easy to apply on iPhone5.
0.32613248	0.6103857	Took one of the three to get a feel for the product, then one poorly applied to my 5S, then one perfectly applied to my wife's 5C.  Definitely remove your phone from its case and use the dust stickers to get this right.  Also, only try a maximum to two tries.  Beyond that and dust is statically attracted to the material and you'll have dust spots under your cover.  For the price, I'm going to order more just to have around when I'm ready to give my 5S another shot.
0.064223796	0.569433	I was really excited when I saw these for less than $7.00. When I tried them on I had to use all three of the screen protectors and now I am out and it's still really bubbly. I would not recommend these.
0.9977381	0.7900673	Have been using this for 2 weeks now, so the review may be a little premature. So far, the screen has been working exactly as advertised - and exactly as I hoped. Works well, fits well, was easy to install, and definitely worth the price ($9).It would be great if there was one for the iPad as well.
0.98435986	0.7927071	Easy apply and easy to get rid of the air bubbles came with cloth and 2 extra screen protectors def bang for the buck
0.86620754	0.6956965	Tech armor will send you a new pack if you wreck any of them trying to put them on. I have never had a more tricky screen protector but once you get it on it looks great.
0.0066878497999999995	0.5076822	It was fast shipping but, protective film sticker is missing.When you try to put this screen protector, you need find green sticker and red sticker in order to install and red stickers are missing with 3 screen protectors.Waste my time for waiting and refund.
0.9685148000000001	0.72117746	This is the best screen protector for your iPhone! I love that the matte finish doesn't let fingerprints show so I don't have to constantly clean the screen.
0.92317545	0.7371892	The anti glare feature as well as the anti finger print feature are what makes this product so wonderful! It doesn't need changed as quickly as some of the other products out there.
0.42556095	0.55696195	I've only had it for one day and I can still see the film underneath the protector.  I'm hoping it wears off.  Also it took me 3 times to get one to look good on my phone.
0.9571991	0.7012795000000001	This is the second time I have bought this brand and my boyfriend likes it a lot, while I had bought the Tech Armor HD Clear (which isn't so bad either--its all on preferences). It is easy to apply and the instructions that comes with it is wrong. I just ended up youtube-ing how to. Overall, I would definitely buy this brand again and forget going to Best Buy where the Invisible Shield is so expensive, not to mention the guys that charge $7.00 to put it on for you. No thanks! Buy Tech Armor and you won't be disappointed!
0.9907411	0.8730991	This is one of the best screen protectors that I have ever purchased. It was very easy to place on the iphone and the cut-outs aligned perfectly with the iphone's layout. I removed all the bubbles quickly with the included squeegee. The initial residue feel after placement wore off within a day or two. It does not hinder the clarity of the iphone's retina display nor the touch screen responsiveness. Highly recommended.
0.9877473	0.8295564000000001	Very nice screen protectors. Was very easy to put on and lays down flat without any bubbles. Much better quality than the one I got with my otterbox case that I messed up and had to replace with this one.
0.8599098	0.7205351999999999	I have used the screen protectors by Greatshield and they are very good. They go on the IPad andI Phone with great ease and no bubbles .These ones leave bubbles and I wasted most of Them and still have bubbles. I did it according to the instructions and still no success. I don't think I will buy them again.
0.98498356	0.7917042	Easy to apply and comes with a very useful lint removal sticker (aside from the lint free cloth that usually comes with other screen protectors).
0.66248727	0.55163044	I went through all 3 in the pack just trying to get rid of the dust particles that get trapped under the screen protector. I had one that came with my Otterbox and I never had that issue. It went right on with no issues and no fuss with any &#34;dust removal tape&#34; that does not work anyway.
0.7795036	0.59718573	I had to use two of the them to get it right so that no air bubbles show. Overall, it seems to working well.
0.99523616	0.7272911	Awesome love my privacy screen protector. i love that people can no longer snoop into my conversations and can not see what i am doing
0.83736974	0.75288296	everything is as described on a website, fast service, it was easy to put it on the screen, and if not there is two more
0.90756977	0.6902214	I wish it were a bit darker other than that it was easy to apply and I didnt have a problem with bubbles.
0.9438933	0.76214385	The quality is amazing! the feel of the screen is like having nothing at all. Also I use it with a case and it is totally case friendly, so far all the edges are still stuck with no intention of peeling off.
0.5082591	0.6134589	This is the first screen protector I have owned. Due to not liking the feel and look of most. But I have to say on my second try I got it to look like it wasn't even on. Looks and feels great, smudges less than the screen.
0.3526783	0.52504146	Does what it's supposed to do. I just had trouble with keeping dust and lint out before the final sealing.
0.99556863	0.78873503	I was very hesitant to buy a screen protector for my phone, after a bad experience attempting to install one on an iTouch. But since all the built in screens only come on cases that are big, bulky and ruin the beauty of the iPhone I had to cave in and give it another go. Originally, I attempted to install one that came with my case... it was a disaster. Unlike tech armor's cloth (included in this pack) the microfibre left lint on my screen creating as many problems with dust as it fixed. After reading the reviews about this companies customer service, I decided to give them a try. Wow, was it worth it!I followed the included instructions (didn't even go online to watch the video), and was able to work out the few bubbles that were present after the install. I am a perfectionist, so trust me when I say it's perfect! I can't even tell it's on, and it only took about 5 minutes to install! Packaging was great, items were great, and service is excellent! 5 stars to company and product!
0.82383597	0.7731866	I'm unimpressed by its performance.What I didn't like:1. Scratch marks from coins and keys. I thought this was tough and durable like what the other reviews say.2. Compared to my friend's security screen protector, you can still see what I'm doing on my phone (text, surfing the web, taking a picture), you just can't see the words. This screen protector is good at blurring words, but it's not good at hiding completely compared to my friends.3. It's really not crystal clear.What I did like:1. Easy to put on2. Thick quality
0.7622969	0.7355701	Easy to apply, but the cutouts are slightly off. Does what it's meant to do though and protects from scratches. Besides the area around the cutouts, it doesn't even look like there is a screen protector on my phone.
0.9622464	0.76178604	I just ordered this item yesterday and received it today. I have used many screen protectors in the past and this one I must say is the best so far. I went through the first two by allowing specs or dust to get under the screen protector, but on the third one I moved into a different room and made sure no more dust specs crept under there. The only way you will get bubbles on this screen protector is by dust, I don't have dust under, so I have no bubbles :)It is definitely recommended by me to get this screen protector, other ones are known for being difficult on the bubbles. Fast shipment, crystal clear, and no unwanted textured feeling. 5 stars :)
0.9295583000000001	0.68085694	Tech Armor is the best manufacturer of screen protectors in my eyes. I will never waste money again getting the BIG named screen protectors. These products are easy to apply and are backed by a lifetime warranty even if they don't do well. . .
0.99699694	0.81526136	This is a really nice product. I've been using it about a month now and it adheres to the screen without problems - and I've always got my iPhone tumbling around in my pocket, at work and at play.I also thought the installation instructions were very clear and simple, and was glad to find three screen protectors in the package. This should keep me going for quite a while.I will buy this product again when and if I need to.
0.88513935	0.6830173	The protector was pretty hard to get exactly in the right spot, but if you're determined to get it right like I was it can definitely be done...
0.0051153004	0.28424266	DO NOT BUY... Product was terrible, had a weird glaze to the film and it looked distorted on screen. Really strained eyes. Junk!
0.7214643000000001	0.5173424	When this screen saver is applied correctly (unfortunately it took me 4 tries...I purchased 2 packs until I RECEIVE a case with a built in screen protector) - I think I FEEL LIKE IT SAVES MY SCREEN - I'm not too sure about how the Warranty works - I need to find out because I fear that I may not have adhered it COMPLETELY - I followed all the enclosed instructions and I have applied MANY SCREEN SAVERS BEFORE ... This one feels good and leaves very few fingerprints. In BOTH 3 Packs, the &#34;dust removal tape&#34; was not &#34;tape&#34; as I know it, but when applying screen protectors, I have learned to keep a piece of scotch tape on hand for any dust bits or hairs that may have grabbed the adhesive when applying. It's a good product, I gave 3 stars due to the prior issues I mentioned - I still want to know about the warranty - the 4 last ones I applied did not adhere properly at the corners& it does bubble a bit - it's ok
0.99445796	0.6878694000000001	This item was easy to apply, and am completely satisfied with the overall item.  The product met all of my requirements. :)
0.9721991	0.7421515999999999	I checked out Otter but this is far better and has a great feeling, not to big and not to small and protects the iphone perfectly :-)  Love it
0.34682673	0.39613813	The screen protector and customer service is outstanding. However, I've requested a replacement unit twice now and haven't received anything, I don't know what's up with that. Kind of disappointed.
0.9916832	0.7976798	Easy to put on. Great quality. It has a very clean look. A lot of people have asked where I got the screen protector.
0.9704119000000001	0.8042228	i bought this to replace another screen protector for my wife's iphone because the previous had a sort of moire pattern when applied and had a rubbery texture.  the Tech Armor protector was very easy to apply and didnt require a spray like the previous one I had bought.  The protector would have gone on flawlessly if I didnt have it at a slight angle when I applied.  There are only to very small bubbles at the top give any indication that there is a screen protector on the phone.  otherwise it applies seamlessly and you cant even tell.  works fine with the &#34;Belkin View&#34; case that I have for the phone.
0.86938334	0.5777826	Thought there is one in one pack, and the surprisely found that there are three in one pack. Great purchase experience.
0.9937358000000001	0.8792962999999999	I have purchased many different types of screen protectors from the time I became a smart phone user five years ago. Up till now, I have experienced different problems with each. Most other ones tend to fall off quickly or get scratched easily. The invisishield ones are a rip off as well.Looking for a cheap protector once I got my new iPhone five, I clicked on this because it was the first link. I bought it. I was very happy because for a great price, I got three awesome protectors. They stick on well with ease. They're cut correctly for the phone. They don't scratch easily. And I was able to get it on without air bubbles.
0.9921274999999999	0.8271003	Its a good screen protector, that fits the iphone 5. The audio, camera and home button have cutouts for them, which fits perfectly. Need to be careful while install as a single speck of dusk can ruin the installation.
0.12933141	0.432058	If these came in a 20 pack for $6 that would make more sense. It's nearly impossible to apply these without getting dust or particles trapped under the film, which then show up as bubbles that you cannot squeegee out with the little cardboard piece they give you. Maybe if I had 4-5 more attempts in a vacuum sealed room with absolutely no dust particles floating around I could get a nice, clean application. Fat chance, as soon as you start to peel off the 'Back' layer a static field begins attracting dust and small fibers. These things are literally dust magnets, I should throw out my dust rag and just start using these to dust my house. I'm fed up.
0.97795904	0.64368725	Just what you'd see in stores but much more affordable and arrived when expected! 3-pack was a plus! Great job!
0.98500836	0.8015021	I read a couple reviews on different protectors, this in my opinion was the best - unless you go the pricier route with ZAGG or Bodyguarz, but those from my understanding are not compatible with cases. This one is great! and i was able to use it with the Speck Candyshell Case which was exactly what i wanted. It was easy an easy application too. It is on the thinner side, no bubble/glare problems.
0.99290526	0.8142661999999999	Easy to put on, and fits the phone well. I am a happy with the case. I just got my phone this week and put it on.
0.9973035	0.8041537	Finally I can be on my iPhone without having to worry about people looking over my shoulder looking at what I'm doing or who I'm texting.
0.631117	0.5975251	I have the white iphone5 and it looks awkward on a white iPhone.  It definitely looks better on a black iPhone because the screen protector is practically black itself.  Was I disappointed in the purchase? No and it's a good thing I didn't buy one for 25 dollars at best buy.  The effectiveness of the protector is mediocre at best, you can still see screen at an angle, but it's only slightly blurry.  Applying it was easy.  No bubbles.  It also makes the screen a little grainy.
0.96962786	0.7877090999999999	I was kind of skeptical about buying another screen protector because i had such bad experiences with them in te past. I switched over from a Droid to an Iphone, and i was thinking hear we go again. Suprisingly, i had no issues, and it fit like a glove the 1st time, had a few bubbles, but i was able to use the plastic board to smoove it out. PERFECT!! Very Happy with this product. :-)
0.9976454	0.8694004000000001	Fast shipping, great product easy to do. Exactly what it says in description. No finger prints, really no glare from bright lights or sun. Great product.
0.24632809	0.49164128	It left bubble on the screen when I tried to apply it. But customer service has agreed to send new pack at no cost. Will try again.
0.99320865	0.74165833	the product was soooooo easy to install and instructions were easy to follow. the product is the best  I've  used on my ipad2! hint: turn off pad overnight and install next morning...I will purchase again.
0.8840914000000001	0.6437546999999999	Love it! The screen protectors are great. They work exactly how they should. I had a problem putting one on the second phone. It was my fault, I don't think I did it right. I emailed the company to see about a replacement. They returned my email within minutes! After giving them some information about my purchase, they are sending out 2 replacements. The whole process took 2 emails that were returned immediately! This company has a great product and excellent customer service. Will absolutely purchase their products in the future!
0.16190043	0.45588973	They get a star just for shipping it to me. I watched the tutorials and applied the product exactly as instructed. However, the removable films left adhesive residue on all three screen protectors. They all had to be thrown away because I didn't want to constantly look at a streak of residue between the phone and screen protector. Don't waste your time. Tech Armor, you're the worst.10/1/13 Edit: After contacting customer support, Tech Armor sent me replacement screen protectors, and they arrived in the mail quickly. Thankfully, the replacements did not have the same defect as my original shipment, and they worked perfectly on my iPhone 5c. While I'm definitely impressed by Tech Armor's responsiveness, they still get a couple stars knocked off their score because I was originally shipped a defective product and had to have new a product re-shipped.
0.96665215	0.7243482	This a great screen protector. It does not scratch and has a lifetime warranty. There are many others like it available but they seem to scratch in time. This one hold us to its claims offering excellent protection for your iPad or iPhone.
0.9741636	0.7828187	When I got my new iPhone 5 with T-Mobile, I ordered through Amazon the OtterBox Commuter Series Case, a 12 volt car charger and this HD Screen Protector.I called Otterbox since it comes with a screen protector and the tech said that their screen protector was very good, but it has a limited warranty.  The Tech Armor has a lifetime replacement warranty, and it is also designed for the retina display of the iPhone 5.  I did not want the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint (matte finish) screen protector that Tech Armor also sells since I wanted to see my retina display with a clear screen protector.This is excellent, and when I take my iPhone 5 out with me when I am playing golf, I find that glare is not an issue in the golf cart.  In fact, I think that I will buy one for my Garmin Approach G6 Golf GPS unit.  I have a screen protector on it now, but it is dull, and makes the screen seem not as clear.On my iPhone 5, I will take a soft eye glass cloth and wipe down the display and it works great.  I recommend this for a clear HD display like the iPhone 5 has.
0.844778	0.7324887	Heh.  Well, I've got bubbles, fingerprints, and have the thing on a little cockeyed.  But I get two more shots.  I wasn't sure if the thin piece is the protector or if it's the thick one.  And the removable tab #2 wouldn't come off without leaving a residue.  Finally figured out that the thing is in *three* pieces and the thicker one in the middle of the sandwich is the actual protector.  Good to know.  Mine goes on the iPhone 5.  Looks like it will be a good fit with accurate cutouts once (if) I ever get one on right.  And I even watched the video!
0.99690926	0.8584693000000001	Easy to apply and works great. I was a little hesitant to buy it because of all the rediculous application methods people said they needed for it work, but I had no problems whatsoever. First try and done. No crazy steam or fan needed and no bubbles or lint underneath. Now I can finally put my phone in the same pocket as my keys without being paranoid I'll scratch my screen. Yay!
0.39621246	0.6968356	I give the product a three because I've had one of these before for a previous phone, so when I got a new one I immediately ordered this. It worked great for the first couple of minutes I had it on until I noticed a bubble.. I couldn't handle it because I would feel it whenever I typed in my password. So I tried taking it off and readjusting it only to end up ruining the thing in the process... Its a great cover, but don't mess with it once it's on. You'll end up like I did, with it in the trash.
0.6361277	0.60438246	This is really great quality item. Note that this is matte, so it will reduce glare from the sun.  Like all protectors it's tricky to install. I know how excited you'd be to receive this and immediately try to put it on your iphone, but STOP. Read the directions, watch the videos provided, read the web site instructions and then do it. Don't hurry, as you'll be looking at the product of your work for months or years to come.
0.985821	0.8576568000000001	I bought this screen protector set as I screwed up the attachment of my free cover that came with my iPhone 5 case - which as most of us know is easy to do!I found this set to be an improvement over my free one. The lint cloth and card were very useful in removing any dust from my screen and also for smoothing the protector down as I applied it. The addition of a sticky patch to get dust off the protector itself as it is applied was of great use.The only negative comment I have is that the slits for the camera and speaker at the top of the screen are a bit wide, while the hole for the main button down the bottom of the screen is just the right size, meaning any of this extra space on the upper slits is pointless as the lower hole must align correctly for the protector to be on properly.I managed to get the protector in place on my second attempt with this set, leaving one spare. I think that this set should be viewed as a single application, as most users will screw up one or two, and any extras left at the end should be viewed as a bonus.All in all, this is a good product that I will buy again if I have the need for more.
0.9454271999999999	0.809639	This is a great product. As other people have said this is a very thick screen protector but it works well. I would definitely recommend getting this if you often commute on the bus as other people can not see from any angle but directly on the screen. I am not very good at installing screen protectors but this one was very easy to install.
0.91546285	0.74564373	i got this yesterday, pretty nice touch on my phone, easy to applied in an clean air environment, i just break on cause make some dust on it, it's from the air and i can't do anything so solve, so i tried to use second one in any clean way and succeed. recommend it for everyone,
0.74229014	0.6525569	Much clearer than Zagg shield, With Zagg you get weird waving warping things on the screen, but not with this, this is pretty much HD when I applied to my screen the iPhone looked much clearer than when I had the Zagg on, PLUS NO FLUID LIQUID SPRAY STUFF!!!However applying is a little tricky it is easy maybe 10 min if you're a beginner, BUT after applying I still have air bubbles that seem to have developed some kind of white grain of salt looking thing literally under each of the screens and the bottom half of my iPhone has dust sealed in with the screen protector, but these are probably some of the best screen protectors on the market
0.99458724	0.70444024	easy to use, easy to apply, just plain easy! I cant even tell I have a screen protector on that's how clear it is. Great price, will buy more if I need to.
0.93421537	0.7760611999999999	Easy to put on, got it on first try and and it looks great.  It does show finger prints but it has kept my phone scratch free.
0.013414055	0.41752994	These screen protectors suck! i just noticed my screen brightness was on the lowest possible and when i turned it up people next to me (not in front of the phone) can see everything i'm looking at on my phone. what's the point of having this thing on here if everyone can see what i'm doing on my phone! asking for a refund...totally unhappy. don't buy these.
0.99463487	0.84794503	I tried several screen protectors in the past and this one works very well. It's easy to apply and you can't even tell it's there.
0.9991011000000001	0.85146075	Thank goodness this comes with 3! I was just idiotic and in a hurry to go somewhere with first 2 tries & wasn't careful enough, so tiny bits of fiber & dust got caught in between. Applying screen protectors has always been a challenge for me.Make sure you're in the best lighting possible, wiping the screen with the given cloth tediously, & looking at your phone from every angle. I used my glasses lens spray cleaner to help a bit. Though the cloth helps immensely & you can't do without it, it can leave little fibers behind too, so if you're having trouble wiping every single one of them off, a piece of scotch tape or the tape that's included can definitely help take away the remnants.I personally find it easiest to line up the protector with the home button & bottom edge of the phone in its entirety, rather than just using one corner. Third time's a charm! It finally went on perfectly! Nothing caught in between & just a single tiny bubble that smoothed over with my debit card in an instant. I am in love with this matte screen protector. I'm so stoked about it that I'm writing a review on Amazon for the first time! Fits perfectly & looks amazing. I will definitely purchase again.
0.95698047	0.46486762	I like it very much I love One more good good. wait a minute I don't want to write more
0.9879749	0.7883986	works well, fits right on the phone, seems sturdy.  You might need to clean your screen before you put on the protector.
0.9753620999999999	0.78037906	This is a very good screen over! works as specified and better. It took me 3 tries to get it exactly right but it looks spectacular. You can't beat the price either.
0.19077483	0.6483711	I bought this specifically because of the matte description.  This has a semi-gloss to it which irritates me when the light hits it.  It doesn't hinder the picture quality of the iphone but beware that it picks up your fingerprints like crazy.  I carry around a cloth to wipe it.  You can't just use your shirt or anything to quickly wipe to regain the picture quality.  It will just smudge your fingerprints more, causing a haziness.  It's like fingerprints or how you glasses fog up, just plain annoying.
0.99573064	0.74271953	So easy to install (I was worried about that!) no bubbles and great instructions. I would definitely recommend! And they give you 3 in case you mess up
0.9981653	0.79535365	Love this matte screen protector.  I can use my phone when I'm outside on a sunny day. I love the feel of the matte and it looks great with the iPhone 5. It's easy to apply on and it a perfect fit.
0.9535319999999999	0.6996423	this shield is about the fastest one i have put on a phone smooth and clean install. the price may be a bit high but it is worth the price
0.8666668	0.66712844	This quality of this product is good! I have had no problems with the screen protector, since I got it 2 weeks ago. I watched the video online on how to apply this product to my phone. However, I still faced challenges on getting it aligned just right. I had to throw away my first one because of how often I had to keep adjusting it. The second screen protector went on fine, since I had some practice with the first one. I like the product! I would just appreciate another way of putting it on.
0.11414221	0.5005837000000001	"I received the privacy screen protector and it already had a scratch going across. I put it on for a few days and contacted the company, they said they would send me a new screen protector, free of charge. It had been 7 days since they emailed me the confirmation, so i emailed them back and they said they would send another one. I still have not received either of those protectors. They should really stick to their word of ""Lifetime Warranty."""
0.25989473	0.6897755	I am a perfectionist and the features advertized by product manufacturer must hold truth. Tech Armor fails and has betrayed my purchase upon arrival. My previous privacy screen for my iPhone 5 was far better [...]I will be as specific as possible regarding Tech Armor's failures with this product. My previous privacy screen was completely black from about 30 degrees out any direction (4-way) the top viewing angle. This screen does not turn the screen black at any angle - it simply blurs the text. The colors and images on your screen are still visible to others around you!Finally, the screen makes everything a little blurry and adds miniscule rainbow spots all over your screen (especially apparent when you background is white). It isn't a big deal but a small flaw that is discernable and can be annoying.I just got my screen on April 2, 2014 and it's a brand new package.Some positives: it goes on easy and smooth. They provide all tools (micofiber cleaning and dust stickers) to help you place it carefully. Overall, don't buy this. It is not the best for your bucks.
0.15073648	0.42310348	I got this be aye my other phone had got a small scratch it. Even though it didn't effect the phone function it was still annoying. So when I ordered it for my iPhone 5 it was a no brainier. I had a hard time putting them on though. Used all three up.
0.93619084	0.65247434	No bubbles, very nice and you need just following procedure for installing screen protection. Customer service are very friendly and respond in a hour
0.8295304	0.7346848000000001	I bought this screen protector due to the great reviews, I received it very fast and was pleased with the instructions and with the protector in general, the issue u have is that it scratches too easily, I was under the impression it was scratch resistant, now less than one week of having it installed and has already a couple of scratches that a very noticeable and are driving me crazy. It looks like the iPhone screen is more scratch resistant than this protector as before this protector I had the phone by itself and have had no scratches whatsoever.It might end up removing this protector if it gets one more scratch.
0.99909955	0.7711525	It is by far the best screen protector I have bought. The application (if following the provided directions) was pretty much flawless and I love the matte look it gives the phone. I highly recommend.
0.22448894	0.43602243	I had two phones to put the screen protector on. Mine is a black iPhone 5 and my fiancee's is a white iPhone 5. The screen protector was easy to line up on the black one, but was very difficult to see against hers  (the white iPhone). I ruined one and got so-so results on the second try.All in all, the screen protector was worth it.
0.66167337	0.51289004	The directions are in such a small font, I needed a magnifying glass to read them.  I used all 3 protectors provided, and still ended up with dust particles.  I sent their customer service an email, but no one ever responded.  I used a different brand on my iPhone 4 that was much easier to install.  I would not recommend this brand to anyone.  Too difficult to get it lined-up and to prevent dust from getting on the cover in the installation process.  That's my story, anyway.
0.97813296	0.7427358000000001	Great anti- glare product. Would like to recommend this product to everyone.You cannot get a better product then the Tech Armor.
0.09936473	0.44466713	I was not going to write a review, but I got too many reminders asking for one.  I found the screen protector relatively easy to install. However, I was using it to replace one that came with my otterbox case and it did not work with the otterbox because it is smaller than the screen and I could not position it so the otterbox would cover all the edges.  I also found it reduced the visibility of my screen so I removed it and discarded the spares.
0.9981759	0.89384186	I'm very much pleased with the purchase, sturdy material, very durable, great quality.I have it on my phone for several months already and have no scratches on it.I recommend the product...
0.7346381999999999	0.75769085	I used to use other screen protectors that had a less glossy finish. I like these better because they look just like the screen and it's very easy to swipe my finger across. I didn't watch the application video, and therefore pulled the backing off incorrectly on the first one. But, there were two more in the package (only $6 for 3!), so I got it right the second time. There are no bubbles and it's lined up perfectly!
0.98685265	0.7533810000000001	Definitely glad I got the three pack.  I am a little OCD when it comes to these kinds of covers, so having backups is key.  I actually wasn't satisfied with how I applied the first one, but got it just right with the second.  Having a practice cover is very helpful.
0.9968459000000001	0.8939707	These iPhone 5 covers are the best available on the market. No fingerprints, no glare. I have read my phone in the bright sun at the beach and have no glare and a clear view. The matte finish keeps fingerprints at bay but still shows great graphics quality of the iphone.
0.8713299000000001	0.8202986999999999	These do exactly what they claim. I have a Pro-Clip mount for my iPhone 5 and the glare from the sun severely limited it's usefulness. These work perfectly to eliminate the glare. If you're wearing polarized sunglasses though, you'll probably still be out of luck....no fault of Tech Armor, just a fact of life with polarized lenses.  These go on pretty easily if you read the directions. I did not on my first attempt and had to give up on that one & try again. Peeling the backing off as you apply it to your device screen is critical to success. My only complaint is that the air bubble remover is just a piece of cardboard, and after you've used it once it's pretty beat up and flexible, so if you have any screen protectors left in the package be prepared to pull out a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles. Also, there is only one &#34;lint remover&#34; included in the package of 3 screen protectors, so once you've used this sticker once to remove lint as you apply the screen protector, you have nothing left for any remaining screen protectors. Why is this important? Because once that backing is removed to reveal the adhesive, every speck of lint & dust within 6 feet of you will instantly attach itself to the screen protector. The lint remover is necessary and there should be one for each screen protector in the package. Having no need for the 3rd protector in the package, I gave it to a coworker, but without the bubble remover (destroyed after initial use) or lint removal sticker (already used the only one in the package). Best of luck to Karl trying to install without those. Anyway, once installed, you will have zero air bubbles (no joke, no exaggeration) and a screen that is visible in bright sunlight and does not show fingerprints & smudges. If that's what you're after, you'll find it here. The trade off is a marginal reduction in image quality on your screen, but that's a trade I'm more than willing to make.
0.9942674000000001	0.7990321	Probably one of the clearest screen protectors! It was definitely a great screen protector!  I recommend to any one who is looking for a screen protector! Good job tech armor.
0.06983584	0.48718497	I ordered this product, after 20 days no shipment arrived.  I contacted the customers service directly through Tech Armor and received an email stating a replacement shipment was in the mail.  I did not receive that shipment either.  Since I dealt with both the seller and the company directly and neither can get the product here I would never do business with them again.  Simple.
0.9497575	0.76061416	"I've just had the most amazing tech support I've ever experienced. After installing Tech Armor iPhone 5 screen protector, I had a minor problem with one of the installation tabs. I sent an e-mail to tech support late afternoon (Pacific time)  on the day before Thanksgiving, expecting a response the the following Monday, or later. Within an hour I had a response, an apology and a promise to send a new protector, even though I had created the problem. The following morning (Thanksgiving day) I received a note from tech support advising that they would be sending  the replacement protector via First Class Mail. That's a tech/customer support model that we could only wish for from others.The Tech Armor protector replaced a similar protector from another company. Despite my fumbling, it was far easier to instal. Moreover, it provides a much clearer view of the screen than did the earlier protector. Based on this experience, the Tech Armor product gets five stars and a well-deserved ""thank you"" from this customer. They know how to do business!"
0.9937353000000001	0.79763526	"Goes on easily and is cut perfectly and is also crystal clear. So in a word ""Perfect"". And by the way this was for the iPhone 5."
0.06634539	0.4089583	Yea, they give lifetime warranty, which means free replacements until the product is EOL.But it is also a lifetime waiting time to get your replacements, i requested replacementsfor the Galaxy Note II, that was a month ago, and guess....  nothing...do yourself a favor and get the originals, or the ones from verizon, they hold way better forthe samsung devices...
0.40602115	0.46594712	This is a stealth product! The privacy that it has given me back when I receive a txt or a phone call is incredible. I say buy one!
0.99831915	0.8973341999999999	We just got our first smart phones - late to the party, but making a flashy entrance with iPhone 5s. Several people recommended getting screen protectors so I ordered Halo regular ones and these Tech Armor anti-glare, anti-fingerprint ones. I was suspect about those claims so wanted the Halo, just in case I found the Tech Armor to be unusable. Well, the Tech Armor screen protectors are fantastic - they really do keep glare down and make a nice matte finish on the screen rather than all the fingerprint smudging when using no screen protector or the regular Halo ones. I just ordered another pack so I have a back up - they're THAT good.Very easy to 'install' - very durable - and definitely make for a nicer finish on the screen.
0.76166475	0.6654675	The matte finish do keep the glare to a minimum but you'll still see the light reelection. Overall I like it, got a few scratch on the shield already. Rather that then the actual glass itself, highly recommend it.
0.0047109425	0.5978697	Very disappointed. These are just pieces of plastic and they are not anti glare / anti fingerprint. I compared it to my husbands screen protector he purchased at an APPLE STORE and it is completely different and is truly anti glare/ matte and anti fingerprint. Very disappointed and will be throwing away :  (
0.0078473985	0.36401442	I've applied dozens of iphone protective screens, and these are the worst. Used up all three, and even the third one produces bubbles that cannot be removed. I'll go back to other brands that I know work.
0.5020059	0.34219778	Sorry, this is just not as good as PowerSupport AG SP which I will wait for.I can't find any iPhone 5 Anti Glare protecors that I'm happy with.
0.9586135	0.8392947000000001	I've been through a few different brands for my iPhone.  This one is good.  Stays on well, clear, nice invisible look.  It does get pretty fingerprinty, but that's not really a big deal.  I had originally bought their anti-fingerprint one, which was good but was a little too much anti-glare, which made it hard to read with my sunglasses on.  If you're a stickler about fingerprints, though, get the anti-glare version.  It has a &#34;rougher&#34; texture that blocks fingerprints.
0.9930724	0.7797437	I have used many screen protectors but none compare to this one! Goes on pretty easy and comes out looking like nothing is on there! You seriously cannot tell you have a screen protector. This is amazing!
0.9831675	0.7050046999999999	the anti-glare aspect is what I was looking for.  Works great! The protection is just a bonus. If you're are looking for the same, purchase with confidence.
0.65252846	0.5705893	I've used expensive shields in the past and didn't like the feel of them nor the look of them. But this one is great! Feels just like the normal glass and doesn't change the appearance.
0.20839807	0.6948941999999999	I wanted to try this out because fingerprints and smudges get on my nerves. This particular screen protector does most of its job. It doesn't leave fingerprints and the anti-glare works pretty well.The things that I don't like about it...The matte finish sort of sacrifices the retina-display. It makes the display slightly fuzzier than without it. I went from the Samsung Epic phone to the iPhone 5 so the retina-display blows me away. With this protector on, it just makes the display a little less enjoyable.It's also annoying to hear yourself swipe the screen. The matte finish is not quite a smooth surface so if it's relatively quiet you're going to hear your fingers rubbing the screen. So for me, it gets annoying. I had my phone for 2 weeks without a screen protector so I've been use to feeling a smooth and quiet surface.I'll stick with this for now but I can definitely see myself just going to a clear protector.
0.8214651	0.7696851	When I picked up my new iPhone, the Verizon guy put a screen protector on that they at first wanted to charge me $10 for (3 for $25).  It did not have a non-glare or non-fingerprint surface and so by the end of the night, the surface of the phone looked the same as if there was nothing there, which is to say disgusting and greasy looking and covered with fingerprints.  I ordered this one immediately.  It goes on easily and looks great. I mucked up the one -probably a different brand- for my iPad so badly they had to send me a new one so I was happy that this was trouble- and anxiety-free.  When the phone is sleeping, there is a matte finish to the surface.  All the holes are aligned well.  I am very happy.  The package comes with three which must mean that this doesn't last forever but so far I think it is a great product and highly recommend.
0.64396405	0.81135726	Good thing this came with 3, because it's a bit hard to apply with the lint free cloth.The lint free cloth actually creates a lot of lint/dust, you should wipe the surface free from fingerprints, then wipe the screen from top to bottom in one motion.  Use plenty of bright light to check at an angle if there are any lint.Then take off adhesive #1 off and slowly align it onto the screen and peel it off slowly and apply onto the phone screen.  it is ok if there are bubbles, I had some major ones and small bubbles I thought I couldn't get out, but with the lint cloth covering the cardboard card, I was able to push the bubble out and GONE! you can use your fingers as well.It's ok to scratch or do what you need to to get the bubbles off, because when you peel off adhesive #2 (be careful not to peel the screen protector layer), that is the actual screen protecting your phone.My first attempt failed, there was lint by the home button and it annoyed me for an hour. Glad there are 3, for any mistakes.I originally had the skinomi, which isn't a hard plastic, it felt more like a rubber piece, and you had to wet it, which could potentially damage/short circuit your phone.  At an angle you can see the indents and un-smooth surface.  Techarmor makes it seem like there is nothing on the phone. Now I have a very clear screen, looks screen protector-less. Using a tech 21 case, the screen protector doesn't have bubbles on the borders, which the skinomi had.Love it, and customer service is awesome! very quick response and replies.Now the real test is...how does it react to scratches from keys in pocket and other objects....time will tell.
0.9984611999999999	0.80583096	I loved this so much! The installation was simple and easy! My screen was very nice and crisp! I had less fingerprints too! I was so happy when I got this! The shipping was nice and quick! The customer service is even better! I messed up my first one and they replaced it quickly! LOVE THIS SOOOOO MUCH!
0.99104166	0.7105735	Love the matte finish on this. Takes a few tries to get it just the way u want but then it blends in perfectly! I use mine in combination with my Otterbox for added protection.
0.42421317	0.5940113	Decent product.  Good price.  Same annoyances to apply as any other screen protector.  Only oddity is that the cut-outs at the top (for earpiece and front camera) were not centered on mine.  Not a big deal, but imperfect
0.9797403	0.6953439	These protectors are simply the best. You don't need to keep looking. They are more expensive than other protectors but these are worth it. And the customer service is GREAT!!
0.9929216000000001	0.7212546	exactly what the description says. great product. easy to install if you read the directions and follow them. five stars
0.9514687	0.74819964	I tried a different screen protector that I bought from Amazon (can't remember the name) and had to replace it after 2 months.  I tend to drop my cell phone into my purse with keys and whatever has accumulated in there.  So far so good with this one.  No gouges yet, and it's staying put.
0.28068992	0.5521095	Nice product, however after a couple months it did start to form bubbles and attract some dirt around its edges
0.83602226	0.6521934	The product itself it awesome. I haven't seen too many scratches on the screen since purchasing it. It has also protected my screen from a lot of dirt and food particles. I just wish that the application was a little easier. I kept having difficulty getting a &#34;dust-free&#34; environment, and so the cover would not go on properly.
0.9855825999999999	0.7973201	This screen protector is awesome! I've used so many and this one was easy to put on, no bubbles, it looks perfect. The only thing is that since its anti-glare/anti-fingerprint the screen has this matte effect that makes the screen a little dull. But I really don't mind it, it's exactly what I wanted.
0.11874434	0.37874037	I have always put my own screen protectors for my phones and this time I havent been able to make this one work correctly. It is just way to complicated to make it fit. I just wasted two of the front protectors. I have one more left and it is really a pain.
0.017204076000000002	0.62973565	I ordered this product thinking about it's good reviews and how it said it was easy to apply. When I received the package, I noticed that some of the protectors had fallen out of the small plastic slips they come in.When I looked closely at the protectors, they seemed to have dust particles and scratches already on them. I followed their instructions on both the card and website they provide and also did the installation in a humid environment. I had no luck as the dust bubbles were already on the screen protector before the first label was peeled off to reveal the adhesive. Every protector was like this. I contacted them through their e-mail they left on their instructions card that came with the product and it has been a week, no e-mail. I am very disappointed with this product as well as their lack of customer service.I am shocked to see that this has so many good reviews and they look fake to me. Just look at all the negative reviews. They seem to have the same problem I am having as one customer noted it already had scratches on it where mine had scratches and dust particles. It says there is a lifetime warranty so I hope to get my money back or at least a replacement. I did not want to write this negative feedback but your company gave me no choice as I have not received any word from you regarding the email I sent. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. Waste of money and does not even work properly!
0.81094563	0.7499628	Def does what it says. Can't complain. Very helpful especially when you're in the sun. My husby & I were in the very bright sun the other day. He kept trying to cower over to make shade and put his hand over his cell to black the glare so he can read on his cell. Neither worked so he used my cell. It was nice that I didn't have that problem. =)
0.87912655	0.66870594	It took me two times but I finally got the protector installed and had a little problem removing the tab, it's was really stuck to the protector. Thankfully I still have an extra one!  Super quick delivery.
0.9901173000000001	0.7348901999999999	This product is exactly as described. If you follow the application instructions, you end up with a good anti-glare screen protector.
0.93158495	0.6532140999999999	These High Definition screen protectors are a god-send! Once they're properly applied ( and let's be honest, getting it right the first application is a challenge but that's to no fault of these in specific ) you will forget there's a film of protection over your phone! There's no hinderance between you and the screen and its sleek.Of course, you will smudge the film-- but that's only to your fault. Wiping clean these screens is simple and isn't required most times.I would reccomend!
0.9374449	0.5878188	This is the best protector for the I phone 5. The product arrived on time. Answers on all the needs.
0.9987315000000001	0.81087464	It is a perfect fit for my iPhone 5 and was easy to install.I love the Tech Armor screen protectors .
0.51398635	0.5640343000000001	i somehow managed to screw up on the first try but with the second try it went on perfectly no bubles at all.
0.8934901	0.6780361999999999	I realized that my screen protectors came faulty and was given new ones, no charge. Best screen protectors on the market. Not cheat but your money is well worth it. Take my word for it, considering I bought cheap ones and these were superior.
0.9902946	0.7769301	All I can say is wow. Installation was simple and flawless. If I didn't know that I had put it on I wouldn't even notice it. It's that clear. My iPhone 5 retina display isn't hampered by the screen protector and still looks flawless. So happy I have 2 more.
0.9215741	0.7704673000000001	So they shipped quickly and that's made me really happy because my old screen protectors were garbage. These don't scratch as easily, they are easier to put on, and it comes with more instructions/supplies and makes it a whole lot better. However I've always had trouble putting these things on so as always I failed my first two but luckily my third one wasn't perfect but one of the best I've put on yet. I just have trouble aligning the screen protector and getting the dust off under them because that's what causes all the bubbles. Anyhow the product overall is very great just know that there still a little difficult to get on perfectly and that you might have trouble with the first ones you try to put on
0.7712463	0.7197386	I bought this at the same time as I bought a greatshield for my iPad. The greatshield had defects embedded into the film that made the application without bubbles impossible. Tis was defect free and easy to apply.  As others suggested, I watched the video first as I've had issues installing these in the past and I think it helped.
0.56205535	0.5630225999999999	It works good. As all this kind of protections you have to be very careful during the installation. The product is ok, it fits ok.
0.7190324	0.7017299	I always get my wife to apply these since she has a much better touch.  She had some difficulty because she didn't realize that there was a peel off on both sides of the plastic and she had removed the peel off on the non-sticky side.  There are 1 and 2 markings on the sheets but you have to read the fine print to know what that means.  Once we figured that out, the protector went on and has only a minor bubble in one spot.  So if you figure out the sticky side, the product works good.
0.0039322376	0.5380351999999999	It does not have the twin pack for both front back of the iphone. Not worth to invest in this product.
0.5375014	0.581306	This product does exactly what it says (at least for me any way) with only one issue....it feels a bit strange. Not sticky or harsh almost like frosted glass. It does not appear to have changed the screen resolution but the way the screen feels when you swipe your finger across it. So, simpley be aware that this texture is not what you are use to but not bad just different, worth it but different.I will absolutely continue to use this screen protector and depending on how it wears over time will likely reorder when necessary.After months of use I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5.
0.82510585	0.7496463000000001	Very easy to installcomes with dust tape to help take dust off that likes to get on thereand for a very cheap price
0.9747814	0.8172897	Works very will, after you get everything lined-up. After peeling the protective cover off, I had trouble with dust getting on screen protecter. I did get it on without any dust. Easy to clean,and stays clean for long time.
0.99915063	0.8899585999999999	Excellent screen guards. Very easy to apply, and actually substantial Thickness unlike any other screen protectors, aside from of course glass ones (i.e.: Spigen GlassT) And a lifetime warranty even from scratches, installation mistakes, bubbles) What more could you ask for! These are one of the best film screen protectors I've ever used.
0.27623403	0.4610652	After some usage you will see slimy layer coming up and that doesn't go..even after cleaning it. Its quite irritating after sometime.
0.4671803	0.49362558	I gave this one star before.  The company gave me a replacement twice.  The first two times I always had bubbles,.  I received my second replacement, but that time I decided to get a scotch tape, the one you use to tape big boxes, even if it is totally clean. I figure a lot of things may not be visible to naked eye. Wala, no bubbles---totally no bubbles-- The thing that made this spectacular is I had a Rokform iPhone case.  I took out the red rubber covering the sides  and left the black enclosure.  It is a perfect fit. You would not even think there is a screen protector.  Customer service never gave up on me, even if I completely lost hope.
0.9978093000000001	0.7973988000000001	Love this for my iPhone 5. It's a matte finish so no sun glare. Easy to apply and keeps that expensive glass safe! Note that you get 3 protectors. Great deal!
0.9305351000000001	0.7542678	i like the protectors; they are as described and shown. however, since i am still new at putting on the protectors, and i like things to be perfect, i used all the protectors already..i'm using my third one right now, but there are still bubbles.
0.99661815	0.75998473	Nice and easy application, good range of coverage ESPECIALLY when paired with the Otter Box Commuter. In love with the anti glare, so glad I picked this protector.
0.009588629	0.40825993	I'm very unhappy with this screen protector for iPhone 5! The holes for the Face Time camera and the Receiver are cut unnecessarily large and off center, which makes it impossible to line up the screen protector properly.
0.98436	0.48868838	good product and excellent customer support they listen to customer and stick to there words amazing very good experience with them
0.41440079999999996	0.38274795	There's nothing wrong with them I guess, I just expected something special for the price. Gets the job done though.
0.9568429	0.76414275	Our first Tech Armor screen protectors lasted 4 years, in fact they outlasted the phone. First thing we did after getting the new phones was order our Tech Armor. While not the easiest application for older hands/eyes we enjoy a product that does what it advertises. The video touted in the instruction manual was appreciated. I did notice that if you don't get all the dust off you will have bubbles that won't go away (we ordered the 3 pk for a reason LOL). We love our Tech Armor, set it and forget it's there.
0.95607364	0.83912075	As with any of these types of screen covers, getting them applied correctly can be tricky.  I ended up with a one persistent spec of dust on my first try, but since they supplied 3 covers, I just used the first one like an extra dust removal tape and the second went on great!The covers are cut just smaller than the front glass of the iPhone 5, so it should be fine with cases that don't have much front overlap.  As you would expect, one it is applied it is almost invisible, you only really notice it if you see the cutouts around the front camera and speaker.  Touch input through the screen works great.  There is a slight difference in feel between a light swipe on the naked screen versus the protector, but the phone has great response so there isn't a problem and I stopped noticing the difference after just a couple of days.
0.7370259	0.59005255	"It is easier one to be applied on the phone, not like other ""soft"" protection. Plus you get 3 packs, means 3 chances to apply. I wasted one, and finally got a perfect one."
0.9813390999999999	0.79438126	The matte screen protectors were very nice. I had a hard time installing them the first time and I contacted tech armor and let me tell it is the best customer service I have dealt with. Very fast and they even offered to replace mine because of the lifetime warranty. Would definitely buy from tech armor again and I encourage you to do the same you won't be disappointed.
0.47900188	0.5752738000000001	So much better then the ones you get at Verizon when you get the phone. Won't use any other ones.
0.7104066	0.67124504	It really doesn't show fingerprints and is non glare.  I had the other type before Nd this one is much better.
0.90244466	0.7333113	The screen protector is amazing and it looks at though nothing is there! However, all three times that I put it on it seems as though it wasn't modeled right for it because I put it perfectly on the bottom but it wasn't aligned at the top, it's whatever though just be careful when putting it on. Overall the screen protector is amazing and it's definitely better than the high-end ones out there. I would really recommend this to everyone!
0.9669368	0.66136456	The price was very reasonable and it worked as advertised. It'll be a good gift for any friends who have the phone!
0.95391405	0.7156745	Fits the iphone 5 perfectly.  Keep in mind that, as stated, the protector is matte and changes the appearance of the screen to a degree.  I don't mind though, as my laptop screen is anti-glare as well, and I am used to the look.  Easy application and snugs up nicely to the edges of my poetic case.  If it gets a bit smudgy, which is inevitable, just use the included microfiber cloth and it cleans right up.  Cool beans!
0.98812467	0.7861991	I bought these because of the price and I was surprised by the quality of the screen protectors.  A+ in my book.
0.97120667	0.83319426	I've used no less than 10 different types of iPhone screen protectors.  Most are either difficult to put on (Zagg, invisible shield, etc.) or just plain suck (too thick, bubbles, folds, etc.).  These are the best covers out there.  They are very easy to apply bubble free.  They also stay on once applied.  Others that go on easy often fold up when a case is applied.  This one does not.  I use a Speck case which curled the other easy apply protectors but did not curl this one.  Great product!
0.24638456	0.30323958	The item came with 3 covers and when i received my iphone5 I didnt bother to read the instructions on how to put the protector on and screwed it up. I took the 2nd and followed the instructions and it went on without a problem. Follow the instructions to victory!
0.07365644	0.5194742	I'm a perfectionist, and I have done quite a few installs in my time.  Bought this for my 5s and couldn't for the life of me line it up correctly.  I didn't have this issue with a generic brand on my 4, 4s, or 5.Wasted all 3 protectors in a span of 10 minutes, complete waste of money.One of the issues was that the included cloth added more dirt than it took off, and then using the sticky tape to remove dust didn't really help much.Completely dissatisfied with this product - but a lot of people seem to be happy with it.  I'm not sure if it's just me being ultra picky or not.
0.06939247	0.46246597	I put these on my new iPhone only to have it get scratched a couple months later.I haven't used a screen protector in months and nothing has scratched my screen at all.
0.98780066	0.6569015	no bubbles, applied in one go. really loved this one. I have used so many screen protector, and I think my experience with this one is the best.
0.9950459	0.78005624	Exactly what I was hoping for from this product.  It was easy to install and had great instructions/tips for applying the protector.
0.21632126	0.56825316	The Only problem is that it won't fit under the edge of a slider case on my iphone5... ... ...
0.2789119	0.4279981	UNLIKE SIMILAR COVERS I HAVE USED FOR CAMERA PLAYBACK SCREENS WHICH APPLIED QUICKLY AND EASILY, THIS SCREEN WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO APPLY WITHOUT GETTING DUST AND BUBBLES UNDERNEATH THE SCREENOUTSIDE OF SCREEN ALSO ATTRACTED DUST AND MADE PHONE DISPLAY APPEAR SOMEWHAT DULLCOMPANY SENT ME FREE REPLACEMENT SCREENS WITH SPECIFIC APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS BUT I AM NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT USING SOMETHING THAT MAY DETRACT FROM DISPLAY QUALITY
0.9322388	0.7039628000000001	Works as advertised! And through the otter box too! No one can see my screen any more! My eyes only.
0.985283	0.8144965999999999	These take some time to get on properly. It is really a two person job. But once on, this screen protector is AMAZING. No glare, no fingerprints just like it says. My phone is always looking very clean with this on.
0.9808834000000001	0.72972256	Best screen protector that I've found. Follow directions for application and you'll have no bubbles. Can't even tell that the phone has the screen protector on it which I LOVE! Definitely recommend. You won't be disappointed!
0.986757	0.85331136	When I got my iphone5 I installed the screen protector that came with my otter box and I could not stand the fingerprints on my screen all the time so I did some research and the Tech Armor screen matte protectors came up and I'm really happy with my purchase... No more fingerprints or having to constantly clean my screen!!! The installation wasn't too bad either... I got a few bubbles the first time but I quickly removed it and used the dust removal tape and it went on perfectly the second time around.  I definitely recommend these screen protectors!!!
0.5219897	0.62866265	I had difficulty with my first attempt to install a protector sheet. However, the manufacturer graciously and quickly replaced the set. That is a very big plus for this brand. Now that I have overcome those initial difficulties, I can offer a more objective initial assessment of the product - and, as noted, my first impressions are mixed. I'm a neophyte in using screen protectors and have no previous experience for comparison, but thought I'd try with my 2nd iPhone (never really needed them for my 1st). I found the installation difficult, with extreme care being required to avoid even the slightest spec of dust - not easy in most environments. Now the challenge is to keep the surface of the protector itself clean enough to enjoy the benefits of the iPhone display. This is challenging, not least because, unlike the iPhone screen itself, the protector is not oleophobic. So, it smears and gathers dust that is not trivial to remove. Also, I've noticed that the edges of the protector sheet are beginning to detach after only 24 hours of use - but not yet enough to interfere with the benefits of the protectors. So, I'll keep an open mind, and continue assessing my experience.
0.97859657	0.806932	As with all of these screen protectors it is nearly impossible to apply with no bubbles, but I was able to get it applied with just one little bubble the first time. It is a very good value though and with the cost difference of buying in store you can afford to try multiple times to get it perfect. Besides the 1 bubble I can't even tell it's there and the surface has a very clean and smooth feel. I definitely recommend.
0.9813881999999999	0.76675975	Went on quite easily thanks to the instructions and products they included in the packaging (particularly the tape to remove dust particles). Has a very nice feel and looks nice. Recommended.
0.9986734	0.8340143	great price early delivery easy to put on the phone great product. Matte finish is great shows no fingerprints. Would recommend to a friend.
0.97545934	0.74593145	I've tried for the 2nd time, and looks great!First was for the iPhone 4S and now for the iPhone 5. Great so far! I've only used 1 of the 3 screens that comes along!
0.7609868000000001	0.7791225	The package includes 3 pieces of screen protector and simple instruction. The first one I applied created very few bubbles if any but I didn't align it perfectly that my phone case will constantly peel it off on the sides. I wasted the second piece again because of bad alignment and I failed to notice that I need to eventually peel off the seals from both sides of the protector.The third time is the chime and everything works great. It still has a very tiny dot (not sure if it was bubble) but I can live with that without problem. I think this protector will last for a while.Conclusion:Because it comes with 3 protectors and seals on both sides of the protector, you can theoretically make mistakes up to 5 times until you get everything right.With the price of $5.95 and very good quality, I will recommend this to anyone.
0.64388657	0.5560608	I couldn't manage to get either on (my package only came with two, for some reason) without the horrible specks of dust, but they did apply noticeably easier than other products I've tried. They have a different feel than most screen protectors but I'm sure it's just an issue of getting used to. I had to discard them because of the mentioned dust, but I'm sure they would satisfy most people.
0.42372167	0.73258424	"Love it. Easiest screen protector I've ever applied to my phone. No touch sensitivity problems, no display brightness problems. I've got my brightness bar probably 1/4 the way over and I can see the screen easily.**UPDATE 09/03/2013**First layer of screen protector is literally peeling off around the ""home"" button and the camera at the top of the protector. Not sure if this is an individual problem on if it happens to everyone. I halted the problem by cutting the peeling part off, but this only worked for a few weeks, then it started to peel again. It's almost as if the protector is made of 3 layers. The second layer has started to peel as well. I would just peel the entire layer off, but doing so pulls the entire screen protector off."
0.6023852	0.62850463	I bought these because of the reviews.  I had trouble applying the protector to my iPhone.  I think the white iPhones are more difficult.  By the time I realized I had ruined the first protector I was very frustrated.  That didn't stop me from going through the other two protectors.  By the time I finished, all of them had been thrown in the garbage.  After I cooled down I contacted Tech armor.  They got back to me very quickly and were super nice.  A few days later I had three new screen protectors.  I read about a technique using tape to hold the protector in place and it went great.  It's hard to tell there is anything on my phone's screen.  It's a great product.I am not a review writer but I had such a good experience I had to submit this.
0.9961059000000001	0.7856456	Loved it, easy application and its nice to have extras. I also bought an Otterbox Defender case for it as well. So I have two layers of protection on it.
0.9186209999999999	0.73493415	This screen protector was a breeze to install.  Just make sure your screen is free of dust beforehand and use a really bright light to help you align the screen protector on the phone.  I can't even tell this protector is even there.
0.44760543	0.5028412	For about 45 minutes I tried installing the screen protectors in relatively dust-free environment, carefully following the provided instructions with no success at all. Frustratingly, I had to do it at a third-party kiosk in a mall.
0.9722066999999999	0.68132377	Great product, great price. If you had to replace your defective iPhone 5 (as I did) or just want to protect your new toy, look no further.
0.9533554	0.74847883	great pruduct! got in sooner than expected. feels great. covers the entire phone thats what i was looking for.maybe a little bit bulky but phone is now so thin that really can not bother you..
0.97922766	0.7554513	The best screen protectors I've ever purchased! I put one on my phone a couple months ago and to date there are no scratches or marks of any kind. It's still PERFECT!!!
0.9737928	0.71924055	I found this protector comparatively easy to install. I like the matte finish, which is what I was going for as against the glossy finish.
0.995144	0.8282021	Installation was straight forward and everything needed was included in the package. The website has videos to help and mine went on without any bubbles and was perfectly clear. My iPhone 5 retina display looked the same as without the protector as it did with.
0.89308405	0.77018285	I had issues but learned fast that applying these in low humidity causes dust to be attracted to the protective films.Install in your bathroom after you've showered and they melt right onto the iPhone screen - Its like butter!If you get dust on the films, you can pick them off with good ol' scotch tape. Not a problem.Great price and,...Excellent customer Service, Tech Armor!!!!
0.98495996	0.7383138000000001	The instructions were clear for application and the screen protector aligned well with the iPhone.  Very happy with this purchase.
0.03662607	0.63086414	Product arrived as described and on time. Not particularly difficult to install, especially with the help of the online videos on their website. I am disappointed with the appearance however. The cover produces a grainy look on the screen and resolution is impacted negatively. The screen takes on a softer matte finish which was as described but the grainy look is a downgrade. Maybe it will grow on me. The finish resists finger print marks nicely. Overall an ok product but I'll probably swap this out over time to a clear finish; it's disappointing to see the beautiful retina display downgraded by the cover.
0.3297321	0.5182146	The actual one that fit is great, but I paid for a pack of three that only had one that fit the Iphone 5. I would like the other two sent to me asap please
0.030344784	0.54374886	instruction were not good. the numbers 1 & 2 are not displayed prominently. though the package had 3 protectors as promised, the 2nd & 3rd pieces were stuck together and as result had to be trashed. i was left with only the 3 piece to be applied on my phone.
0.98879313	0.84579116	Also doesn't distort the images on the screen or interfere with the display resolution. I highly recommend it for anyone who is hard on their phones.
0.74162734	0.6252403	I was super skeptical of screen protectors. I didnt want air bubbles or a less sharp screen.I saw a friend that had this on his, and it didn't inhibit the screen, in fact it made it easier to look at in the sun.Im glad i got the 3 pack because i ruined one trying to put it on improperly. It's really not that hard, but if you're confused look it up. I was trying to put the wrong thing on my phone for almost 15 minutes.
0.70159996	0.5771727	Matte-like finish distorts image on iPhone5. I have a different brand for my Samsung Galaxy 3 III that is crystal clear.  I will never buy this brand again.
0.9988935999999999	0.7408887	Easiest installation ever- just watch the video, follow the directions, and don't rush. Definitely  happy with the product. Glad I spent the extra money for the quality and a company that is concerned with customer service!
0.4163239	0.6108118	I get that they cut the holes a little bit wider and off-center to accommodate the proximity sensors and such, but was that really necessary? Also, no back screen protectors included, which I think is an unfortunate oversight.
0.9955309000000001	0.8079206	Product came quickly and was just as described.  It took me 2 tries to get the cover on right (I left 2 small pieces of dust on the screen that created a bubble) but with a little practice I got it on fine.  Love the screen protector.  Great feel, nice protection, perfect fit for my iphone 5.  I like that it just slightly tints the screen view...makes it easier to read, especially in the sun. Great value, great product!
0.028919011	0.47288149999999995	Bought this to avoid purchasing new auto phone chargers but unable to use. Not compatable with Otterbox case. Don't know about other brands of cases.
0.010859996	0.5719038000000001	After receiving the product I put it on my iPhone and it started to bubble after a day or so. Then according to the label it promises no anti finger print. That's not the case either.
0.6102051	0.6626313	Extremely easy to install, no bubbles, and the touch is fantastic - almost as if you don't have it.Very important: do not waste time and just watch the video. You'll be done in 2 minutes.
0.9917530999999999	0.6846685	Good price. Good product. Easy to apply. Clear instructions including video if needed. Still enjoy the retina display on the iPhone 5.
0.9926354	0.83607435	I bought these screen protectors for a remarkably low price on amazon and am completely satisfied.  I, maybe luckily, had no trouble at all attaching the first one of the pack with no trouble.  I did it unde an exhaust fan in the kitchen which helped pull all the dust and particles away from the phone.  If in any doubt about your screen being clean before hand, clean in some more and just take your time.  Once it was on I honestly could hardly tell there was anything on at all, it is crystal clear and has stayed that way for the two weeks I have had it on so far.  I recommend this to anyone, anytime.
0.96189356	0.6978109	i bought this, and they didn't go on at first so i emailed them and they promptly messaged me back saying that they will replace it at no charge. their customer service is great and their screen protectors are amazing.
0.9935	0.7900056	It fit perfectly no air bubbles and at a very good price. It keeps alot of smudges but easy to wipe clean. Overall the best screen protectors I've ever bought.
0.96599436	0.6101683000000001	Its a good screen protector easy to put on just make sure you use the card that comes with it and good customer service VERY GOOD !
0.7469307	0.5112431	It's a great protection for what I needed it for it fited and it doesn't leave any marks on my I phone
0.91173893	0.66011924	I was buying the expensive ones, but thought i would give these a try.  I can't tell the difference between this and the more expensive ones.  I purchased ones for the iPad mini, iPhone 5, and iPhone 4 for a litte more than one set of the more expensive ones for my iPhone 5.
0.9370244000000001	0.74859965	Looks cool to start off with a black out look. Protects your screen. My phone was defective and since this is a quality product i was able to re install on the new one. Love it!!! can't go wrong.
0.8191227	0.58429766	Seems like a solid product. I used all the screen protectors and couldn't get it right.  Sure it's operator error, but I give up on screen protectors.
0.42990524	0.34630343	Thanks for screen protector is very good and kool but never recived my chicken case that i order 2 months ago and never recived
0.99819946	0.7757702	This is the best screen protector I have ever use with my Iphone, it look super clear and it feel really smooth. I definitely recommended this product.
0.9454912	0.7098041	Very nice! Installation was simple. But few dust particles still got trapped. Looks like it is very high quality. Packaging was very classsy
0.93946195	0.8195128	Works perfect, makes it all blacked out when the screen is shut off, no fingerprints ever on my screen, viewing quality is a little less as would be expected with a screen protector
0.99427307	0.7965679	Easy to apply to phone. Screen is made of Good quality materials. Doesn't affect screen quality. Very happy with the product so far.
0.993907	0.7406193	I am so happy with this screen! It looks great! Also, it came very fast! I Would def buy this product again!
0.99644494	0.7211026	Love the product. It was easy to install and had no issues with bubbling. It shipped fast and was packaged very well.
0.9751973	0.75443625	The item shipped when it was supposed to and looks great on my new phone! It was also really easy to put on-- only took one try....  :)
0.61304003	0.59997135	Trying to apply the screen protector as directed seems to be a little harder than it looks. The holes for the home button and front camera didn't seem to match up the first time. After a few minutes of messing with it, the film was applied. It works as it should. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.
0.037139952000000004	0.42044398	Waste of my time and pesos. Low quality product. Bubbled up too much. There are other brands that require no after thought. Apply. And forget. Not these.
0.904171	0.5982519000000001	My son told me I couldn't be getting a real Otter Box Defender for the price I paid. He was wrong. This is the real thing and it came quickly in great condition without hassles. AAA purchase and service. I wish all my on line purchases could be as sweet as this one.
0.21122617	0.38337140000000003	Not centered for the camera- I had to cut it so the front camera would work. Good thing it was cheap, because that is a tad stupid.
0.97924495	0.8138255999999999	The anti-glare finish actually works, and the screen is still looks bright and clear.  Touch response through the film is fantastic -- the phone actually seems to work more reliably now!  (I wonder, are these touchscreens are designed with screen-protectors in mind?)Comes with excellent instructions and all the tools you need to prep the phone and apply the film.The fit is a good compromise...  The film as as large as possible without being too difficult to align.  I wish it was 1mm taller, though -- there's always one tiny corner that bubbles-up slightly because it doesn't quite tuck under the edge of my old (Belkin) or new (DreSuit) protective case.
0.9270212999999999	0.7644361	Easy to install. you can feel the difference in the thickest of the plastic used. But they are still clear and most of all, the edges stay put. Well worth the price.
0.93581235	0.7262683000000001	The sheets are slightly rough which I think is the anti-fingerprint at work. Very little smudges from my fingers appear. The anti-glare works only a little bit in the sun, but it works better under fluorescent light. I'm happy with this purchase because of it's great price and the amount of sheets provided. I would buy it again if I run out of sheets. But it might take a while because I tend to keep the same sheet on for as long as possible.
0.16130036	0.6299449	Fitment is good and looks like it provides ample protection.  The mute switch on the side is near impossible to activate with the case on.  The plastic exterior attached to the case moves around and I don't like the look at all.  It's pretty inexpensive, but I'll be using another case.
0.95802283	0.7998116	These are pretty good screen protectors. There are a couple other brands I've tried in the past that I like better, but for the price I'm pleased with the results. They stick well with a slight tendency to get loose around the edges. This small flaw is hidden by the case I installed on the phone. Just follow the directions very carefully and install them in a dust-free environment.
0.95551395	0.48963642	Is nice , clean look and I can look at my self I'm mirror , lol I love it!!! :)
0.14966494	0.6107581	The product is very good if you just want to keep your screen clean of fingerprints or greasiness. Unfortunately, the downside is it dims the screen and makes it look pixelated. I should have figured that because of the matte this was going to be the result. I'm disappointed that it didn't work out but perhaps other sellers have clear protectors that don't interfere with the image.
0.6248638000000001	0.64065367	This product is as good as any of the other screen protectors I've tried.  HELPFUL HINT:  You MUST have not only the phone as clean as possible before attempting to put these screen protectors on, but also have the area around it as dust free as possible.  I'd recommend putting it on in an operating room... but since they are hard to get into, get the area as dust free as possible.  As soon as you begin to take the backing off these things, they attract dust like a vacuum cleaner.  And 1 little spec of dust on it or the screen before you seal them together and you end up with a bubble.  You can squeegee the other bubbles out, but you cannot get that spec of dust back off again and you cannot squeegee it back out again.  I learned the hard way.  Again.  As I went through 2 of them before I got it to stick with no bubbles.  Again.Good luck!
0.9983146	0.88700247	I've installed a number of these types of protection screens and by far this was the easiest (all three phones in a couple of minutes).  The screen itself is great and the matt finish makes it easy to read in bright light with no reflections.  Overall this is a great product for a great phone!
0.9960155	0.6880906999999999	great support, easy installation, good instructions. This is a great product, no concerns. Buy it if you need a good one.
0.45490506	0.63044095	Didn't even keep this thing on my phone for more than 5 min. Really affects the appearance of Retina Display. Makes everything look blurry. Found a better one at home depot for cheaper and that one goes on crystal clear.
0.0019632876	0.32531554	these are crap dont buy dont buy dont buy!! they dont stick and have tons of air bubbles for the brief time that they stay on]
0.9977367	0.813503	Awesome fit (very easy + good instructions)I had previously tried other screen protectors with bubble no matter how hard I tried. For this one, it was a joyfully easy and guided process.On-time delivery.Good support and customer care.I'd definitely recommend it!
0.83118796	0.65615225	Touch didn't expect that much ... but this Tech armor is so good to have touch ..I will recommend this screen protector !!
0.9638556	0.7846254	Did exactly what it was suppose to. No glare and very easy to apply. Had not a single bubble whatsoever! :)
0.99067783	0.6259521	This product is the best screen protector I've ever used. If you follow the instructions and take your time, results will be great.
0.14897731	0.420416	Normally I don't have trouble putting screen protectors on, but these screen protectors are sticky on the top and it's difficult to remove the bubbles. I ended up wasting the first two screen protectors because dust would keep getting stuck between my iPhone screen and screen protector. Right now I'm using the last one in the pack and it still has a bubble but I don't want to end up with no screen protector so I'm just dealing with it for now I guess. I like the quality of the screen protector but I just wish it wasn't so stressful to apply correctly.
0.9968159	0.87287664	I love these screen protectors!! Much better quality than the ones I bought on eBay. Love that it doesn't show fingerprints, only problem is that it can be hard to apply perfectly, I messed up on two of them on my first try so I only have one left, the one on my phone... Other than that a great product well worth the price!
0.9730768	0.78138244	For such a low price AND the lifetime warranty, I would definitely recommend this. I was worried that it might be more of a screen tint, but it does block any visibility from all directions.
0.9906434999999999	0.82104504	What else do I have to say? 7 bucks for a set of 3 and they are very good, I use the lens cleaner (I use pump bottle) to clean and then a light spray of the cleaner on the iPhone's glass surface then apply the film. It is easy to move them to the perfect fit. Then use a piece of hard paper (included in the box and I think for this purpose, this technique use by those who tint your windows) push off the liquid trapped between the film and iPhone's glass. My 2nd buy so far and highly recommend to everyone.
0.13816887	0.60251117	This product is awesome. I can't tell you how many of these products I have used and wasted over the years. This protector is thicker than most. There were fewer to no bubbles after I laid the sheet down and the provided board smoothed out any remaining issues. It does not visually impact the performance of my iP5. Finally, the product is slightly undersized so that your case won't pique the edges. Don't waste your money on any other product. This is the one!
0.99592113	0.8145925	I am very happy with the screen protector.  I do miss the smooth feel of my other protector, but having a glare-free and fingerprint resistant screen is a very reasonable trade off.  The application was easy and bubbles were minimal and easy to remove.I highly recommend this item.
0.99337256	0.78012216	This is the best I've had yet.  Goes on smoothly and provides a clear view of the screen.  A three-pack at this price is a good buy.
0.9981336	0.8557693999999999	The Tech Armor fits well and is easy to put on, and comes in great colors, would diffidently buy this again.!!
0.9674605	0.62733024	Works just fine.  Very happy with the purchase and glad I didn't pay the inflated apple store price for it.
0.6564669	0.7581201999999999	"The screen was easy to put on but found out that the cut-out on top for the front camera and speaker was 1/4"" off to the left. The offset is so bad that it is noticeable when you first look at it.Contacted the vendor and found out that it was designed that way. So far, it works and protect my expensive phone very well. I love it that the edges stick very well and does not come off like other screen protector. Specirally around the home button where it is used the most and with less contact surface."
0.90884054	0.73606515	I applied this to my iPhone no problem. It doesn't change the texture of the screen much at all but adds lots of scratch protection.Also, I watched this youtube video on how to apply it - made it super easy and I have no bubbles: [...]
0.9984559000000001	0.70969105	It's clear, smooth and perfect!! Just like it describes.....High Definition!! I would recommend this product to everyone.Thank you very much!!
0.9762274999999999	0.66708344	One of my coworker's recommended this to me and it was well worth the money. I couldn't believe that there is a screen protector on my phone.  If one has to buy a screen protector then buy this one, I highly recommend it.
0.12093979	0.33379263	I usually never have a hard time putting on the screen protectors.. but for some reason I could not put these on correctly. I wasted all of my screen protectors, so now my screen is not protected and I have to reorder more.
0.99918276	0.8540536	Easy enough to install following the instructions. Fits my iPhone 5 perfectly. Very happy with the quality of this screen protector.
0.9883504999999999	0.8400426999999999	I'm a matte screen fanatic. Hate fingerprints almost as much as I hate glare. I also like to keep my gear pristine to maximize resale value. It's only been on for a week but so far, the Tech Armor has kept its new look in spite of spending a lot of time pocketed. It's smooth for game play, and I haven't noticed any loss of color or detail. It was easy to apply; actually got this one on the first time, so now I have 2 spares. The few bubbles easily squeezed out the sides. My only gripe was the applicator is cardboard, which is recyclable but not quite firm enough - other brands include a plastic bubble smoother. I used a credit card, problem solved.Tip: when you're applying any screen protecter, have some Scotch tape  or Post-Its handy. Gently drag the sticky part over any remaining dust particles that cling to the film.
0.95362234	0.7592412	Installation is as difficult or as easy as the other protectors. You have to be careful with dust. When it is done, it gives a very clear, quality look. I advice strongly.
0.74570024	0.6328076	Tried installing the Tech Armor Screen Protector, went to site and viewed install video, I had one small bubble that I could not get out, so I used the second screen protector but that appeared to have a mark on it, so I went to the third protector and that ended up with a mess of bubbles. I contacted their customer service they sent out another package, I installed another protector, perfecto! Product and service are excellent, highly recommend. Super clear!
0.99913466	0.8326511000000001	Very pleased with the product...package arrived promptly, online installation video was helpful, and applying the screen itself was surprisingly straightforward.I'm pleased with the result as well - the screen is bright, crisp, and responsive; I could not tell the difference with it on. Great price, too, for three screens!
0.34104127	0.54827887	I have to admit that I myself have not used the protectors, as the sales person in the Verizon store attempted to put the protector on for me when I picked up the phone.  After trying several times, she said that she could not line up the holes properly.  When she had the round hole lined up then the camera hole(s) were partially blocked.  I just took her word for it, and she gave me a replacement that they had in the store.  I have always had the anti-glare/anti-fingerprint version and this version does show the fingerprints, but they can be easily wiped off with a soft cloth.
0.9507821	0.7850942	These are the best screen protectors i have ever used on any device.  Very easy to apply and virtually impossible to mess it up or get air bubbles under the screen.  Will always buy these in the future.
0.23321643	0.45043892	i bought the luvvitt case for my iphone 5s, so i had to buy a screen protector as well.  i bought this one bc of the sheer amt of people that were buying it.  it came with multiples so i decided to purchase.  the first and second ones i tried to put on had dust particles on it (which i think cannot be prevented)-- by the third time, i used the stickers to pull of as many dust particles as i could and was satisfied with how it looked.  it's not perfect as there are still two tiny dust particles that create a tiny bubble of air around them (so frustrating!!!!) but i could let it go bc they are not on the screen, but on the sides and unnoticeable.  next time i would get it done at a store, bc it's annoying to look at the imperfection.  but that's just me.
0.8917757	0.8102796999999999	The purchases cover for my wife's new iPhone five. She seems to like it, I just found that the antiglare feature only work somewhat. You can still see glare on the screen outside, which I somewhat expected. However, there is definitely more glare on my iPhone 4 S which does not have the screen cover on it. The cover hasn't awed textured feel to it. It seems as if it is smooth, but has a flat matte type finish to it.  I'm guessing this is the feature that gives it its fingerprint resistance and antiglare feature. I tech armor seems to be a reputable company that does make a good screen protector. So far my wife has not had any scratches show up on it, and it is held up well.
0.7802131999999999	0.7459167	I had purchased a two-pack of Belkin screen protectors from the Apple store and was very disappointed with them, especially since they cost far more than Tech Armor.  One became damaged while I tried to install it, even though I followed all their instructions.  So I took them back to Apple and fortunately they gave me a refund.  Tech Armor installed a lot more easily and looks so much better.  It really does cut down on ugly fingerprint smudges and glare and has a smooth feel.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  It's a nice product for a great price!
0.8823363999999999	0.7477969	Got it fast and installs ezAlmost not bumps but u can smooth them out ezCame with 3 which is great and ur finger slides with no problemGreat product
0.8976656	0.76919484	Love the anti fingerprint feature - not as shiny clear as regular but I don't have to keep cleaning smudges and prints either while still seeing everything clearly!
0.90286165	0.7259425	It's one of the best screen protectors on the market for iPhone. I have tried many from a few sellers and none compare to this one, it is HD and looks like it had no screen protector at all. I had difficulties installing it because I could never get rid of small lint particles that would leave me bubbles. But finally I my third try I got only one tiny bubble that I could get out pressing on it hard.
0.015605837	0.5039357	"I've had 3 different iPhones and used several brands of screen protectors over the last 3 1/2 years.  Prior to this experience, I only had one other screen protector that was less than satisfactory - and that was one out of 3 in the pack.  This was an utter failure.  The ""tab"" that you use to apply the screen protector won't separate cleanly from the protector surface.  It's as though their adhesive was the wrong type for the task at hand.  It steadfastly clings to the protector so that it's impossible to remove once the protector is in place.  If you get your nail under it and try to push it back, it leaves the adhesive behind - unacceptable.I tried the first sample and messed it up trying to remove the tab.  So I tried it again and failed on the second attempt.Perhaps a bad batch - I'm pretty sure Tech Armor makes decent products - in fact I may have used them successfully on my iPhone 3G.  Meanwhile, I'm going to buy something else."
0.99845695	0.7943485	This was by far the easiest screen protector to install that i have ever used.  It went on the first time without any problems or bubbles.  Just take your time and make sure you read the instructions.  Highly recommend!
0.99960876	0.81912833	Easy to apply and looks amazing on the phone! Eliminates finger prints and glare as well, amazing product! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
0.9994068000000002	0.8490926999999999	After receiving a quick follow up to my initial product review, Tech Armor got in touch with me, offering useful installation tips and a replacement product free of charge. Since I was not interested in any more of the HD screens, I have opted for the Ballistic Glass product instead.This too was free of charge, and I have to say - this is another great product from Tech Armor. It is substantially thicker, providing unparalleled protection for the screen. Touch sensitivity is superb, and clarity of the screen is stunning. I would highly recommend this product for the ultimate protection of your cell phone investment. Massive props to Tech Armor&#8217;s customer service, cheers!
0.987555	0.81449735	I have had a smartphone for over 3 years and I always use screen protectors. I am always looking for the clearest, high quality screen protector at a good price.This is the Clearest, best fitting screen protector I have ever used. And the price is very low for such good quality. Its as clear as glass and it fits PERFECTLY.You wasted your money if you bought anything else.I will never buy another brand.
0.9982661	0.78272426	This item will protect your screen from scratches, is easy to install and worth every penny. Have recommended this item to many of my friends!
0.9979049000000001	0.8473195	This iPhone 5 screen protector is easy to apply and provides great protection without a glare. Application instructions included are clear, and videos of application are provided on their website. Inexpensive compared to others, but high quality. If you're looking for a non-glare screen protector look no more. Plus, three are included so you'll have two for back-up or to share w/friends!
0.028360575	0.5052082	How do you spell crap? Tech Armor, that's how.Having owned 3 iPhones, I know what a pain in the rear it could be putting these screen protectors on. This one is no different.But that's not what makes it a terrible product. Here's what does:It's imprecise. The cut around the home button is more ovular than circle. The width of the protector is inconsistent throughout and is a full mm shorter than the iPhone screen in some areas.The visibility is ok, but considering the rushed fashion in which they made this product, it's not worth the trouble, the air bubbles, and the inconsistency.
0.98334825	0.6678701	this product protects the screen great, i like it!The product shipped it faster than it was suppose to be.Thanks and regards!
0.9731764999999999	0.85883963	The screen guard is looking good on the phone and fits perfectly. Perfectly shaped for the earphone and front camera.Con - it peels out after two to three weeks
0.17851791	0.42003006	I hate to install screen protectors. That being said I am really happy with how this feels on my iPhone. I went through two protectors trying to install this item. After the successful third application, I put the phone back in its Nuguard KX case which has a lip around it. The edges of the protector came up. No matter how I try, I can't make them stay down. It's not visible when the phone is lit but every time I push the side or top buttons the protector moves. Gives me OCD...ha. It is really clear though..
0.6914176999999999	0.47806892	Would buy again, better than most screen protectors I have had before. No bubbles and will let you know more later
0.98334754	0.72692573	I got these protectors because I'm someone that likes to keep my stuff like new! When I received it I was happy because I was going to get my phone the next day. I put the first one on and it had a couple of bubbles but on the corners and they were really tiny but bugged me so much. The next day I couldn't take it and just decided to use another one and this one couldn't have came out any more perfect. It's like if its not even on and that's what  I like the most. I got myself this protector and my husband one for his S4 and put it on his phone and it came out flawless like mine! Definitely worth the price. If anything I will order again.
0.9967518	0.812527	I was very happy with the screen protector! They really are foolproof. I normally have trouble with any and every screen protector I buy, but this one actually works. Even if you mess up its so easy to smooth out the bubbles and try again WITHOUT ruining the whole thing. I definitely recommend this and I think this company makes wonderful products. This is the quality I've been looking for.
0.99374783	0.8272735000000001	Second time I've used these protectors.  They go on well and last forever.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get a screen protector.
0.7815721	0.78540874	Very nice product.  Easy to apply, just peal and stick.  Comes with a nice tape like sticker to remove dust from screen before installation.  Because it is matte, it will distort the look of the screen somewhat.  It makes things a little fuzzy and makes the whites look slightly rainbow like because it is reflecting the RGB pixels in different ways.  I don't mind at all, just something to consider.  I really like the feel of the protector too.  It allows you to very quickly slide through menus and pictures even if your fingers are a little oily.Because it comes with three, I would definitely recommend.
0.98730147	0.82205427	I love tech armor screen protectors, the value is there and the quality surpasses much more expensive alternatives. Throw in the lifetime warranty and its impossible to beat Tech Armor.
0.35705304	0.56276226	Only had this product for a short time.  So far it was easy to apply the screen protector.  Doesn't seem to help or increase glare.  I hope I don't have to find out if this is actually as strong as it claims to be, but for the time being it's doing as expected.  Protecting my screen from dirt and scratches.
0.994484	0.77432936	Smooth, easy to install, protects, and finally price. My biggest worry is smoothness and this product is excellent. Now, for $7 with three pieces, I can get better resale for my iPhone someday. I don't have to worry about banging it with my keys while in my pocket or when my wife is nice enough to carry it for me in her bag.Just a side comment on install. I used the manufacturer video but I also used my other hand to push the protector down the screen. I thought this helped avoid some bubbles. I also notice that if there is a bubble I can lift the protector until I reached the bubble and continue on. Got it installed without a bubble.
0.05291933	0.45310384	This should work well, in theory.  It should also look good, in theory. However that's a negative to both and this product kind of stinks for the iPhone 5.
0.98925185	0.8078935	I used it to cover the cracks of my new iPhone 5 and it installed perfectly! I would absolutely recommend this product.
0.85506815	0.51207477	I bought this product to reduce the potential bubbling that can occur with the brand of phone case that I bought.  Since I applied it, I have no bubbling and all is well.  Thank you!
0.9923379000000001	0.79929656	Screen protector fits perfectly, and it is definitely worth it! The package was missent at first and Tech Armor was glad to send out another one free of charge, they really try hard to satisfy the customers. I have no complaints for the product or the customer service I was provided with.
0.70000464	0.6511425999999999	The product arrived on time, I really like that the HD screen protector does not limit the phone resolution. It brings 3 sheets, I actually messed up the first one when I was installing it. The instructions are not real clear that when you lay it out and remove the final sticker then the remaining film is finally exposed. I didn't know this until when I removed the sticker and thought that I had messed up yet another sheet as I saw a lot of glue left over, when I tried to remove the left over glue from the sticker then the extra cover came of exposing the nicely placed film over the screen. Other than that its a great product, it comes with a cloth yo wipe your screen clean as well as a tape to remove pesky left over dust prior to setting the protector.
0.98382133	0.7585821	Great screen protector, I love how it's not glossy! I hate it when I see all of the fingerprints on my electronic devices, but this one is really great because of the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. Definitely recommend this to other iPhone users!
0.040492	0.4344964	the size of the sheet will not lined-up completely with the phone. It also creates more bubbles than I would expecte
0.9995258	0.7751235	Size is perfect. No problems with application and seems to protect well. Easy to clean. Highly recommended and would purchase again.
0.71067536	0.6352286	"I'll admit I did buy a different brand first. However, that other brand only sent one screen protector claiming ""that's all you'll ever need""... well.. when it's that difficult to apply correctly they should send two.... HOWEVER Tech Armor's screen protector is awesome! They send three of them which can easily last 2+ years if you're not especially hard on your phone. It is a touch difficult to apply... but all screen protectors are. Getting three of them basically gives you one or two practice ones if you choose to... I tried to put one on but wasn't happy with how it turned out so I practiced a couple times with that one (it lost its stickiness after a while). Then moved on to a different one and got it right. It's been 2 or 3 weeks now and works like a charm."
0.9869428	0.7774784	Very Clear, high quality, though quite hard to operate perfectly. by the way, I love the attached dust removal sticker!
0.37755737	0.52363175	Really worth the money, sufficient number of screen protector provided that could let user tried it out by themselves for three times
0.37474036	0.33320963	When I placed the order on Amazon, I thought I was getting the screen protector for my iPod Touch 5. After I got the item today and started to put one of it on for my iPod Touch, I realized that it's actually for the iPhone 5. I went back online to Amazon, my order was set to iPhone 5 High Definition Clear Screen Protector. Then I tried to search again like I had for &#34;iPod Touch 5 screen protector&#34;, I still found &#34;Tech Armor Apple New iPod Touch (5th / Latest Generation) HD Clear Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack]&#34;, which I placed my order with.Now that I had bought 2 packets of 6 screen protectors for iPhone 5, I don't really know what I should do with the rest of 5 screen protectors since none of my family members use the new iPhone. The screen protector for my iPod Touch has the wrong openings and looks weird since there is only the front camera. I am regretting to have bought 2 packs instead of 1 as I know I will change it soon after some scratches.
0.9871218	0.76248956	Pros:Easier than expected to applyDoes not interfere with texting or using appsFits perfectly and does exactly what it shouldCons:Very little to report here, I guess the 1 or 2 little bubbles that stuck around after applying the product is a minus.  They all went away eventually with some elbow grease.Overall an excellent purchase and I still have 2 leftover from the pack to use on other devices
0.6538501999999999	0.72456175	When installed, these screen protectors look as if there is nothing there. They went on easily by following the instructions. It helps to install them in the bathroom after a hot shower as the steam reduces the dust in the air that can get under the film. The only issue I have with these are that there is no cutout for the proximity sensor, when the pic for the item showed there was
0.9939674000000001	0.74465525	Thank you. They fit perfect for my phone. Glad to get rid of the old bubbly one I had before.
0.89431703	0.7707608	This product has great quality, and  very easy to use. Before put it on, should adjust the placement first. once put it on, better not remove it. because the first time you put it on, there is no bubble at all. The more times you try to remove it and put it on, the more bubbles you get. I have recommended this item to my friend.
0.90890604	0.79159373	This screen protector was so easy to put on. I got it on my first try and there were NO air bubbles. You can't even tell that there is a screen protector on. Feels great when you swipe on the screen. There's no glare and the screen protector is really thin. It comes in a 3 pack so that's great too. It seems easy to take off without residue. It has a little space so that it doesn't cover the sensors (2 of them, one on the left of the ear sound speaker and one on the left of the camera). You might not like that, I didn't either but then I realized you can't even tell and you get used to it.It came really quick too, after 2 or 3 days of ordering. They left it in my mailbox.You will be satisfied with it, please get it :) !!
0.94827765	0.76302415	This screen protector is supper clean and thin. I can't even feel there is a cover on my phone. This is also very easy to be installed.
0.8338578999999999	0.7253949000000001	I am not screen protector savvy at all. Video is a bust as a tutorial, company needs to add pro tips and other items needed to install.Recommendations:1.) MUST GRAB SCOTCH TAPE!2.) Clean your hands and WORKSTATION thoroughly.3.) Follow video.4.) Toss removal (bubble/purge) card that comes with kit. Made of paper/cardboard and will leave debris inside edges when removing bubbles (this is when I got frustrated). Grab shoppers membership card, gift card, debit card, etc. Use plastic card to remove bubbles.5.) If you find debris in between screen and protector, wrap index finger tip with scotch tape and remove lint of screen. This step did the job.If you are pro HD, try out the HD screen protector. Will be purchasing that one next time.Overall a great product, however the marketing and support teams need to update instructions and video. I would have loved and raved it communication to the customer (in regards to installation) was clearer.Did contact support via email. Prompt and fast.
0.41480666	0.5304949999999999	This protector eliminates glare so completely - and is almost invisible to sight.  That is, it looks to be the screen itself.  My husband commented that Apple changed their glass considerably with the 5.  Nope...i just changed my cover.
0.8314366	0.68779993	The product was easy to apply after watching the video link (website URL provided in package).  I did get a couple small bubbles at the bottom that I had trouble getting out, but I wasn't as careful as I probably could have been in cleaning the screen first.
0.9799795	0.78575623	I've had iPhones for 4+ years. This is the best screen protector I've gotten hands down!! No creases or bubbles, it's thick and durable, feels AMAZING on the touch screen, and has a lifetime warranty! I'd buy it again if I needed to, but I don't think I'll need to!
0.9962088	0.80369747	Love the feeling of it when I touch my screen and how it has no fingerprints or glare. I highly recommend it to someone!
0.98071086	0.8466891	Probably the best screen protectors I've had on a device over the years. I am terrible at applying these things, so I was pleasantly surprised when this one went on without air bubbles, on the first try no less! Definitely recommend, even though the holes for the front camera and phone speaker are a little off for the iphone 5. The price is excellent compared to Target's price of $20 for 2 protectors
0.09663752	0.45716009999999996	I got the anti-fingerprint/antiglare screen protector and this HD one, so I got the best of both worlds. Athough I liked the anti-fingerprint protector, I don't think it did a great job with the anti-glare. It seemed like it made it worse in the sun.I decided to get the HD protector because the anti-glare/anti-fingerprint screen protector killed the quality of the iphone 5 (take note I'm a heavy user). So, I got the HD protector and it looks absolutely nice! Great quality and super clear. I can't even tell I have it on.The only problem that occurred was the shipping. I bought my first pack and then got an email the afternoon it was supposed to come in saying I'd get a refund. I was pretty anxious, so I was disappointed it didn't show. I received an email from Tech Armor saying they'd send me one free of charge first-class. It came in the next business day! I am awaiting the second pack I ordered after buying the first pack..*****************EDIT*******************I never got the package they said they would send me, so this would be the second time I did not receive their package. I doubt I'll buy from them again at this point.
0.99861604	0.6417632	totally smudge proof! awesome awesome awesome! I love the way it looks and feels. It's matte so very sleak. Love!
0.99810946	0.75841546	Awesome screen protectors and the HD looks great! The price was good as well. I will definitely recommend this product!
0.99865794	0.87932485	This protector went on smoothly and looks great.  I have fussed over many screen protectors, and this was among the easiest to apply without any air bubbles or smudges.
0.6426368	0.62938845	I wish I'd bought the protector that keeps your browsing secret - the &#34;security&#34; anti glare protector . This one also is hard to peel off the backing.
0.9770019	0.8672228000000001	I just finished putting the Tech Armor anti-glare matte screen protector on my new Iphone 5.  I am a big fan of these matte protectors because they enable you to see your phone outside on a bright day unlike the totally clear screen protectors which reflect a lot of light.  Additionally I also like that smudges do NOT show up on the screen and it is easy to maintain.  The Tech Armor screen protector is extremely easy to put on and the Amazon price cannot be beat.  It took me about 5 minutes to line up the film and slowly put it on the phone.  Since they give you three screen protectors if you mess up one of them you still have two others. Just make sure that the phone surface is COMPLETELY clear of dust particles, hair, or anything else before you put the screen protector on your phone.  If you have to redo it get a piece of scotch tape to pull the junk off the phone and screen protector.My only complaint ( a small complaint) is that I wish the screen protector was a little more transparent but I believe this is the price you are going to pay for a matte screen protector.  This is the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall this is a great product at a great price.
0.9948802	0.66558576	Really does a good job. Good price and well worth it. The anti-fingerprint is awesome. Definitely a really good purchase.
0.22063509	0.6639477	Easy installation, and great privacy.  However the screen looses its clarity and a huge fingerprint -like pattern appears throat the screen.  I guess that's the price to pay for privacy.  Not using this product again.
0.002276957	0.41870522	Horrible! Is not recomended to buy it.  Is not resistant. I did not liket it. Pleade check for other options.
0.8838943000000001	0.7203353	even with the video, it takes patience and very clean area, and is not enough the cloth to clean, you need to use a paper to remove little particles.
0.9698450999999999	0.8023749	Reading many reviews on Amazon, I ordered this one for my new iPhone 5. As with many people who wrote a review, I failed to install the first one correctly. But, I succeeded with the second and I'm pretty happy with the way it looks and feels.I may sound odd, but the touch feels better than the actual iPhone screen :). There is no need to worry about any finger smudges and no need to look for shade when it is sunny. This one is just awesome.
0.080038965	0.5680175000000001	I've had this product for a few weeks.  While it does offer some privacy, it isn't that spectacular.  The most annoying thing is the edges are peeling off so I have a white rim around the film.  Not the look I was going for.  I would investigate other products.
0.87954	0.6077726	I read the reviews before ordering this product, so I was extra careful when actually applying the screen protector on my phone. I took my time, but I was able to successfully apply it on my first try and now I'm very happy with the results. I honestly didn't even know the protector was on after removing the adhesives!
0.9892704	0.8030925999999999	This product arrived within 3 days from the date I ordered online..thanks a lot. it is a good product. I just simply put it on my Iphone, started using it. its working great. its very simple to install. I can feel all the features that were mentioned on product features. Your phone looks good if you make sure you are installing the screen guard exactly along the borders of the phone.Finally its worth buying.I will recommend this anybody who is looking for a anti-glare and anti-finger print screen guard for Iphone 5
0.9981984	0.78812957	It is a complete value for money. Great product for great price. It is very easy to install as well.
0.9883870000000001	0.75126934	Comes with a kit and guide to apply this without any bubbles. I did it myself without any air bubbles locked first try. Saved $10 that way.A great guide to make sure customer satisfaction is guaranteed - hats off for that!!
0.99780864	0.8341111999999999	It fits well and looks good and protects your iphone screen. No difference navigating with or without. Recommend this product. :)
0.9976063000000001	0.82363737	These screen protectors are great.. arrived very quickly, just in time for my iphone 5, very easy to apply.. there are no air bubbles and it feels like the protector isn't even there. Perfect!
0.9365009	0.7568059	It came on time and was really easy to put on. I messed up on my first try but had it on perfectly with second film. You can't tell the screen protector is on unless you bring the phone near your eyes. Best is that it doesn't effect the phone use at all.
0.6759693	0.5278510999999999	its a good screen protector for those with clean room (fbi style). i used all 3 screens and i kept getting dust all over the place. i even sprayed a mist of water in the air to keep the dust down. i dont know how you people are getting it on perfect but i cannot for the life of me. there is dust all over the protector. but its $6 so im not gonna cry but these things are a pain in the arse.
0.9959321	0.7737805	I love the matte finish, and it was easy to apply.  I got mine on the first try, and love the smooth feel.
0.9738653	0.7603613	Easy to install, served the purpose while awaiting the arrival of my new case. Cost effective protection, fast shipping, no problems at all.
0.9987789	0.8043224	I love this Protector, easy to install and no glare or messiness from my fingers. I highly recommend it for iPhone 5.
0.0023766160000000002	0.44445273	The product did not meet my expectation. The installation is painful and the glue sticks to the screen which spoils the look of the iphone. Don't waste money on this.
0.9708005	0.8394815000000001	Thsi was easy to put on. Some screen guards which I've used needed a lot of work to get all the air bubbles out, this one was easy (or maybe i've gotten good at putting these on) :)
0.9841277	0.7699136999999999	If you do not like the glossy and shiny screen, this is a great product for you. Minimum screen distortion and easy application
0.9683050999999999	0.7734121	"I received this probably 5 minutes ago from UPS, and I already have it on my iPhone 5 and absolutely 100% bubble-free.  The hardest and most time consuming part was getting it exactly centered on the glass; it's just ever-so-slightly smaller than the glass face itself, and my CDO kicked in (you normal neurotics will recognize that as ""OCD"", but in correct alphabetical order) until I was able get it perfectly centered...we're talking a *very* small amount here, 1/2 a millimeter perhaps.  But after using the lint-free cloth and the sticky dust-picker-upper, the shield went on *perfectly* with not one single bubble left to be seen anywhere.  It very nearly laid down that perfectly, but I did use the included stiff card to squash a few bugs in a heart beat.I previously tried the Belkin brand that I bought from the Apple store at the same time as my phone; two protectors for $15.  Neither one went on very well at all; my second attempt (after learning how to do it better after the first try) was worse than the first.In a nutshell, *this* is the iPhone 5 screen protector that you want to buy.  Three protectors at $7 is a great deal, for a great product."
0.99694717	0.8225596	Great screen protector!! Reasonable price!! Installed quickly!!  This screen protector is good quality.  My screen is crystal clear.  I would definitely buy this item again.
0.8457065	0.8166164	I do have some experience installing these screen shields, so I am not a complete neophyte, but this one slipped right on perfectly the first time. The real tricks are to:1) wash your hands! Seriously.2) clean that screen well with the provided microfibre cloth, and when you are done cleaning, clean it one more time for good measure.3) align the shield using the pads of your fingers and the edges of the iphone. Roll it on sloooowly and STOP about 1/4 of the way down. Check carefully to make sure it won't run off the screen and back track and re-position if necessary. Make the same check 1/2 way down, and if still good, you can finish w/o problems.
0.32154784	0.6005435	This product Im sure is of good quality, they give you most items needed to perform the install, BUT..Without having a Sterile environment, The static Pulls in every little micro particle from the universe, Under the sticky side.. And as far as Trying to get the film to lay perfect the first time.. Nearly impossible.. Each time you remove the film to replace it.. More static builds drawing in more dust.. Id never be happy with what MY results were..The Anti -finger print surface is NOT the best.. BUT. for the Money. Its as good as you will get..
0.87970054	0.7057625	I've used these before, I know how good they are and I don't see any reason to try another brand. But even with experience, I was unable to install my screen protector bubble-free. But Tech Armor stands behind their product with a lifetime guarantee (I never thought I'd use it though.) A quick email from the address on their website is all it took to get replacements sent to me. Yes, they sent three more protectors - I only expected one.Using care, and with the confidence that I had from previous installations, I was able to install the screen protector bubble-free. It is crystal clear, and invisible. The only place you can even see the edge is at the ear slot at the top of the phone. If I don't point it out, no one notices.This is a great product and I now have it on all my phones.
0.99242556	0.72235245	Watch a video or two of how to put this on, then it will be easy to apply perfectly. Great product!
0.96948326	0.7924123000000001	I really like this screen protector. It applies to the the phone very easily and the clarity is outstanding! I have only had it on the phone for a month or so, but it seems to be holding up well.
0.98308575	0.8431655999999998	There is always a better iPhone coming down the pike. So whenever I buy a new one I immediately think of selling it later. For my new iPhone 5S I bought these screen protecters, and I tell you, they are awesome! They were easy to apply without a single bubble.What's impressive is that these screen protectors consist of 3 layers! You peal of the first layer to reveal the adhesive side. Then put the protector on. Then you peal of the top layer. So in the end the protector is so thin that you can't tell that its there. Seriously, you can't!
0.9495155999999999	0.7541156	I like everything about this screen protector, except for the fact that the protector makes the pixels on the screen look a little grainy. AKA, the retina display of the iPhone 5 isn't as crisp. I would definitely rather get the HD clear screen protector by Tech Armor. Overall, Im 99% satisfied with this product. However, I do get extremely oil fingers and this protector definitely fits me.UPDATE: tech armor had sent me replacement HD clear screen protectors as promised. 5 stars!
0.9905415999999999	0.8338913	I was looking for a TRUE CLEAR screen protector. I purchased the cheap ones, they were okay but they made my screen appear weird and they wouldnt stick correctly. I was kind of nervous buying these but Im so glad I did! These are really CLEAR HD, really lets the retina display shine through! plus they dont leave fingerprints unlike the cheap dollar ones. Im glad i bought these, specially for the price! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
0.90427274	0.7645589	While I really like the quality of the protectors, I have difficulty applying them. Granted, I am a novice with smartphones, but I found it tough to get the bubbles out. The card it came with to air out the bubbles was flimsy, so I tried a credit card, with little success. It was a bit difficult to take off the cover, which actually may be a good thing as it seems sturdy. The price was right though! Thank you.
0.9955678	0.85252225	"bought the ""matte"" and the HD clear screen protectors from Tech armor. i have used the matte, for the price its the best screen protector i have bought for an iphone 5, i use it with incipio case, fits fine. no fingerprints and has a texture feel."
0.99223256	0.7800785	These screen protectors look so nice and work wonders! Comes with 3 and are easy to put on which is a plus!
0.8160603	0.84107184	Ok... For years, I would buy screen protectors on eBay from companies overseas. They were extremely cheap (about $1 for 6 of them) and I figured, why pay more?Well, I have an Otterbox case for my iPhone 5, and I was using the screen protector that came with it for about 6 months. Great quality, never scratched, etc. Then one of my keys got loose and put a scratch in it that was too much for it to handle, so I took it off and put on one of my eBay jobs. I was shocked at the difference. The cheap screen protector started getting microscratches immediately, just from my finger and fingernails. (No, I don't use my fingernails on my screen intentionally. Don't even know how it happened.) Within a week, my screen was covered with tiny scratches. I had had enough. I went to Amazon to find a quality screen protector, and found this. Was a little put off by the price after paying so little in the past, but went for it.I got them soon after, got one on my phone, first try. They're cut to perfection; no idea why anyone would say otherwise. Definitely thicker than the eBay ones, and no microscratches have shown up, after a week. Top of it was sticky after application and my finger wouldn't glide right, but after about 2 hours, the oils from my hands did their job and my finger glides like a charm. It does seem to get smudged and stay smudged, but it's only noticeable looking at reflections with the phone off. When the screen is on, it's clear as a bell.I put the 2nd one on my girlfriend's iPhone, and she loves it too. We'll see how it holds up for her, as she's notoriously hard on electronics. :-/ We both have Commuter cases from Otterbox, and they're a perfect fit for this screen protector. It's got about half a millimeter of uncovered space around the edge, and the case covers this up, so you'd never know a screen protector was on it if not for the camera cutouts.These really pay off when the next-gen phone comes out and you want to sell your old one. Having a screen in perfect condition really raises the selling price. I sold my old 4 for $250 thanks to my screen protector doing such a good job.Yes, I would (and probably will) buy these again, and I'll be recommending them to my friends, as well.
0.96783316	0.7892934	This protective screen is by far the best one I've used.I've got an iPhone and I've been using this for a couple of months now.I've had a lot of trouble in the past with similar products with air bubbles.This product did not have that issue. There were some air bubbles forming while sticking it onbut they just disappeared on smoothing it out with the flattener provided.I did notice a difference in the display clarity but I find it negligible.I love this product and would buy it again.
0.36286175	0.8034893	I bought this product because i liked the anti glare and non fingerprint feature. And it does exactly that. It fit great and was easy to apply. However, a big warning is that the matte finish causes a reduced image quality. The iPhone4 and iPhone5 are known for their clear Retina display. This almost entirely counteracts that. If you are willing to sacrifice some picture quality for the anti-glare, this product is for you.
0.17463368	0.40478435	This is a great screen protector for the money.  I absolutely hate sticky protectors and this is smooth.  The only thing I do not like is that ear piece part is not covered 100%.  Other protectors cover the entire screen and leave a slit for the ear piece.  This protector manufacturer did not do that, but instead left a blank space around the ear piece area.
0.0981583	0.47658938	Couldn't be easier.  No bubbles, no lint, and it took all of about 2 minutes.  The film practically applies itself.
0.9974306999999999	0.72915405	I ordered this item for my iphone 5 and it arrived the next day. Installation was simple and quick. I have had it on my phone for about a week and I love it. I highly recommend it.
0.2182973	0.5173886999999999	I needed something to protect the glass of my Iphone which I was told can break easily if it falls on the floor or something hits it.
0.9791620000000001	0.75532603	Fits perfectly. Of course they're tough to apply but once in place, works as expected. I am using an ifrog case and it does have a pesky bubble. Doesn't interfere with function.
0.9923915999999999	0.85842395	This is the 4th type of screen protector I've used over the years, and it's by far the best.  It went on much easier than other protectors I've used and I had a much better result--very few bubbles, and I was able to work them out almost instantly.  The protector has a substantial feel to it and appears to be built for the long haul.  You lose a little brightness with it, but that's the tradeoff for the anti-glare/fingerprint capability.  Company support is excellent--before I installed it I emailed with a question and got the answer back within a couple of hours. Highly recommended.
0.00028151273999999995	0.47028157	Waste of money.  Impossible to align, and the gazillion air bubbles cannot be eliminated, unless you have two weeks to spend trying to scrape them out.No refund, either, because I opened the package...duh.  Spend your money elsewhere.
0.98637426	0.84036124	I was a bit worried since so many people said they went through all three protectors without getting one applied correctly, however I was assuaged by the multiple individuals who mentioned Tech Armor sent them another package of 3 screen protectors for free when they contacted the company. In my experience, applying the screen protectors was not actually that hard. I took the advice of another reviewer and applied the protectors while holding them under my range vent with the fan on to remove any dust particles. What I think made the biggest difference, though, was using the dust removal tape Tech Armor includes with the product. There were a couple moments when dust particles caused bubbles, but the tape did a great job of removing the dust. My only suggestion to Tech Armor would be to include a couple more pieces of tape in each package so customers don't run out. Overall, amazing product at a very competitive price!
0.85577965	0.7670779000000001	It took me all three sheets to finally get it aligned correctly, but it is a great product. It comes with a handy lint-removing tape so there is absolutely no lint on the screen when you place the sheet on. The only thing I would improve is where the removal tabs are. They are located on the end with the large hole rather that the end with the small camera hole, so aligning the sheet is problematic. However, take a lot of time putting the sheet on and you will be satisfied with the results.
0.97662306	0.8253521999999999	Great instruction on applying the screen protector - the adhesive was critical in removing dust particles on the screen and the protector itself. It took a few tries but I did manage to only use screen protector. Smoothed out bubbles and each time I found a dust particle, I used the adhesive to remove it and then reapply. Took about 15 min to get the screen on.So far screen is great at reducing glare and is definitely great for not having finger prints. The only downside is that there is a slight reduction in clarity due to the matte finish. I'd say not enough to bother me, but it may bother some.
0.9931806000000001	0.74656546	iPhone screen protectors were super easy to apply.  Loved how there were three screen protectors.  I gave one to a family member and kept one in case I needed to replace my screen protector in the future.  Thanks!
0.96383476	0.7870958	I ordered another brand before this one and messed it up on application. I Googled how to apply these things without getting any dust underneath (which would drive me crazy). Sooo the best tip I found is this. Take your phone and your anti-glare screen in the bathroom...turn on a hot shower and while the bathroom is all steamy you should apply the screen! The moisture in the air removes the dust. You still need to clean your screen before the application but there shouldn't be dust floating back onto your phone or the screeen while you apply it.
0.99531835	0.81449914	glad i bought it, protects my screen like a champ, adds an added smoothness thats not as glossy and slippery as the iphone screen and def keeps the glare away
0.9581107	0.82273865	I really like these screen protectors for several reasons.  The price is good.  It comes with three covers and it took me all three before I got a great install on the last one.  There is definitely a learning curve on putting these on so the price for three is very good!  I wish that the card that came with it (for tamping out bubbles) was plastic.  After installing the first one, my piece of cardboard looked pretty rough... I wasn't sure how good it was working by the last screen cover but luckily I was able to get it on without bubbles.  Great clarity through the scren protector.  Would recommend, but don't be frustrated if you end up trashing a couple of these trying to get one on, you're not alone!
0.9996878	0.7974465000000001	This is a great product...great price...arrived FAST and worked PERFECTLY!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a phone :)
0.71166134	0.61908	This screen protector definitely gave me the hardest time out of all the screen protectors I've applied. When I finally got the cut outs lined up, low and behold, dust. However, they do include tape for you to remove the dust. There was barely any bubbles despite how many times I pulled the thing off. The card they included to push bubbles off was a lot flimsier than other ones I've used, but it worked. I was surprised how well the film stuck onto the phone despite how much I messed with it, but it's a clean application.The screen protector is definitely very clear. On a white iPhone, you can barely see it. The thickness feels just right, thick enough to give you peace of mind for protectiveness, but not so thick that it just feels weird.
0.99841905	0.82869756	I always get these for my phone so that the screen doesn't scratch.  Glad I did, this one was very easy to apply and protects the screen well.  I'm also glad it comes with 3!
0.363749	0.6217281	"My biggest concern with screen protectors for the new iPhone 5 is that most of them give that ""rainbow"" effect because of the material of the cover and the HD qualities of the screen. I am happy to report that this screen protector looks and feels like nothing is on your phone!However, I will note that it gets dirty (makeup, oils from your hands) more quickly than any other cover I have used in the past, and you basically need to use screen/sunglass cleaner to get it fully clean again. I still think it's worth it to avoid that ""rainbow"" distortion."
0.9989891	0.87450355	This pack of screen protectors was exactly what I needed. It was a great value and came with instructions and the right tools for attaching the item perfectly on your phone. The feel of the protectors are nice and I have dropped my phone multiple times and only had to switch protectors one time so far (I've had these for about a month).
0.94932127	0.76778173	Easy to apply, no nasty fingerprint glares, easy to clean with a cloth & mild cleansing solution.  My only complaint is my phone is almost impossible to read in bright light.
0.99128234	0.83121634	It keeps the screen clear without smudges or fingerprints.I also shared the Anti-Glare Screen with a friend who like it..
0.9879228000000001	0.80082977	Tech Armor iPhone 5 HD Clear works well.  It doesn't appear to diminish screen quality. As with any screen protector it's easy to get bubbles and dust under it if you aren't careful when applying so having 2 extra is nice. The only down side did notice that there are more smudges than when I had the screen alone but it beats having scratches on the screen.
0.955485	0.6079081999999999	An awesome product that fits perfect on the iPhone5.  The day after I got the Tech Armor 360 Privacy Screen, the iPhone5 had an issue that required replacement of the phone.  The Tech Armor screen was damaged when the tech at the apple store removed it and the Tech Armor Team said they would send a replacement free of charge to me.  While I have not gotten it as yet, since it was only 5 days ago, I am not expecting it to be here as yet.  Though the customer service and the ease of dealing with the company is awesome!  I will let you know if I do not get it, though I am confident I will receive it today or tomorrow.  Thanks for the great customer service and a great product that was easy peasy to work with!TM
0.8902153	0.7291852	This is really high definition! I used to have the matte one and I liked it because it avoided my screen of feeling and seeming dirty but the display quality of the screen was really awful... these are great, the quality is awesome! Great
0.93706834	0.70776534	A very nice addition. Glad I found it. Does not totally eliminate glare, but it helps. I just ordered a back protector. Cases, we don't need no stinkin' cases. Yada Yada Yada.....Volada!
0.97619236	0.76513195	they seem fine. It comes with two screen protector protectors so you don't get your fingerprints on it while you put it on. It also comes with a cleaning cloth. Time will tell but so far one of the best I've seen.
0.71443474	0.7435176	Beautiful and crystal clear. Upset i had to use 2 because the first one did not stick properly on edges but the second one looks perfect. Great protection with an invisible look.
0.98858696	0.7645031	Watch the video and you will be all set. It was really easy to install and helps so much with the glare from the sun. made it so much easier for me!
0.99287736	0.76365334	Product was reasonably priced and a good value.  It was easy to install and will certainly provide good protection for the phone.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0.96742976	0.81275225	I decided to give this a shot because it was so much cheaper than the other brands and there seemed to be pretty good reviews. I've always preferred the matte screen for my iPhone because it gives my finger a but more traction, and I like the anti-glare. I have read that people are displeased with how it distorts the image, but I don't think that it takes away from the iPhone display at all. Sure, you can tell the difference a bit, but it's not bad! Anyway, I got the protector, put it on, and instantly loved it. I followed the instructions on the booklet-- only remove the backing about an inch, place it on the screen, and remove the backing as you're running the included card along the protector to avoid any bubbles. It fits perfectly! No bubbles! I've never had this easy of an experience putting on protectors. The best part is that I have two left! Hopefully I'll never have to use them. 10/10 would recommend.
0.9886761000000001	0.82675475	I love it! It's as if it isn't even there. Although at first it took sometime for me to align the protector holes with the camera speaker and button. I still can't get it perfectly but you can't tell at all. This is definitely my screen protector for life. It works wonders! It feels as if you are touching the actual screen. Air bubbles are really easy to get rid of. I absolutely hate air bubbles soo of I am satisfied with it.... It must be good!
0.989667	0.7775245	This (Tech Armor) is a good screen protector for your iPhone. It takes patience to put them on perfectly but when it's done, you can't barely notice it's there. I am delighted with the quality of this good product but what captivated me more is that Tech Armor has an even better customer satisfaction. They make a follow up with you to make sure you do have a great experience with the product and free-willingly offers to send you another one just in case you don't. Now that's customer service!P.S. Be sure to check out the instructional video for some good tips.
0.99376595	0.72288454	Awesome product & at a great price.  Speedy service.  Will buy more of these in the future when i run out.
0.9601963	0.8211415999999999	This sceen protector does a good job of keeping my screen free from scratches and reduces the appearance of fingerprints and glare. This product is wonderful because they give you 3 screen protectors just in case you mess up applying the first one. The matte screen protector does slightly diminish the screen quality but it's a trade off in order to keep away the excessive fingerprints and reduce glare.
0.99942285	0.8081409	Love this product.  Easy to apply and I love the no glare feature.  Delivered quickly and as described. I would recommend this product.
0.90239847	0.7574835	I've bought plenty of screen covers thru the years and  we all know what a pain it is to get the air bubbles out! This cover fit my iphone perfectly and went on flawlessly - not a single bubble YEAH! The only thing I would suggest to the manufacturer is to clearly show which side to peel off first (glad they sent extras - first one was backwards-my bad)I only gave four starts because of how it smudges so easily - not sure that's a &#34;flaw&#34; just my observation.
0.7351656	0.5859721999999999	In my previous review I had issues with the paper tabs sticking to the sheets.  They did send me replacements so I have to compliment their customer service.  The new protector I put on still had the label stick to the surface but this time it did come off with some alcohol.
0.2524413	0.5417276	We did have a little trouble installing, but not too bad. On each of our two phones, each ended up with a bubble near the edge that could not be removed. The biggest problem is cleaning. Without them, a microfiber cloth cleaned the glass spotless, with little effort. With the screen protector, any grease and fingerprints just smear. Any makeup or grease from skin do not come off and cause the screen to look blurry. More rubbing with cloth does not help.I must say, I am impressed with their customer service, as I have noticed that each problematic review has been personally replied to, with an offer to replace or refund. That is outstanding service these days. In some customer service comments, the reply mentions an anti-glare, anti-fingerprint model. I suppose we will try that. Just not sure if that will be easier to clean.
0.97758025	0.8603938	This protector is much, much better than others I've used that made the screen less clear. There's definitely a knack to putting it on the phone - the written instructions just didn't cut it for me - hence the 4 stars. I highly encourage all to go to the Tech Armor website to read their installation tips and watch the video first - something I didn't do, which resulted in a few misses.  But after I did I realized it wasn't very difficult and the third time was the charm - it went on flawlessly, no dust, no bubbles - yay!!  The protector is also extremely easy to clean, even without a cloth, I can just use my fingers to eliminate any finger prints or smudges. .After 2 weeks of use, I'm still quite pleased, so I've now ordered the Tech Armor protector for my new iPad mini and I hope the quality is as good.
0.97301865	0.8199209999999999	Super clear and easy to apply. Just as i expected and for a good  price. Once it gets worn out you can just tear it off and put the extra ones on
0.75115263	0.566991	I bought the Zagg products before and they were good once you spent hours trying to apply them. Honestly, I don't need my screen to withstand the crushing force of a meteor, so this product balances well between convenience and function.
0.0060537755000000006	0.6030078000000001	Applied real easy however..........  It attracts finger oil that results in smear all across the screen that you touch. I took it off within 5 minutes of use. Don't buy and it's a waste of money.
0.98880273	0.7251194999999999	package arrived on time and as how it was described. fit well with my iphone 5, i would recommend anyone to get this.
0.69810367	0.59612834	Before I tried to apply the screen protector, I read the instructions other reviewers had posted.  And I watched the how-to video.  The screen protector went on without a hitch.  There was one tiny piece of dust in the upper right corner, but I lifted that corner of the protector and used the sticky stuff on the dust.  It looks great and I expect it to last a long time.
0.9944586999999999	0.8106088	Tech Armor screen protectors are of the highest quality. I have used them on many of my phones and they still hold up like they're brand new. Also, they offer a lifetime guarantee and are very helpful in fixing any issues that may arise from their products. I will definitely be using Tech Armor for all of my screen protector purchases from now on.
0.97597945	0.7084146	It does the job, keeps the screen nice and clean while protection it. Will buy again and use it. Thanks
0.9913639000000001	0.81561387	Very HD. No loss of brightness or clarity with this screeen protector. Great product for a good price. Great buy.
0.5666167	0.56137216	I was trying to find a good screen protector thats not even noticeable , this was a good choice but it would be a lot better if there was a case friendly one , I might cut one up and see if it helps
0.7648028	0.726688	nice protector it wouldn't reduce the retina quality at all ....  the only problem with it is attaching finger prints
0.9720114	0.81225646	The privacy screen was a little too grainy for me, I found it hard reading anything with a white background (like Facebook). They were quick to respond to my questions and sent a different anti-glare filter no questions asked. Great company and great people to do business with.
0.4415379	0.648235	These screen protectors are incredibly well made and ridiculously easy to install.  No peeling back a backing and slowly nudging bubbles out as you roll it onto the screen.  Simply peel the backing off, line the protector up with the home button and let it gently adhere itself to the phone screen.  It's stupid easy.  I wasted at least $40 on other brands that I got frustrated with and just threw in the trash.Here's the best tip I have found... wrap the little bubble-remover card with the include screen cleaning cloth and push any small bubbles out with it.
0.9872809000000001	0.85076165	I just received the screen protectors today. Before you put the protectors on go to their web site and watch the video on installation several times, it helps immensely! I watched the video, did exactly as instructed and in less than 10 minutes I was finished only using one protector with no lint or air bubbles! Works and looks as if nothing is there. Highly recommended product. Now I have 2 additional protectors to use when this one becomes worn.
0.9936559000000001	0.88200796	I was looking for a product to protect the screen of my iPhone 5 while reducing reflections, glare and fingerprints.  The Tech Armor Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint screen protector does a GREAT job, and installation was easy when following the enclosed directions.  The product definitely eliminates glare and resists fingerprints, with very minimal effect on screen resolution.I'm very impressed with the fit of the product over the screen.  The cutouts are extremely precise, so you want to make sure product alignment is correct during installation.  It's also important to make sure that the screen is completely clear of fingerprints, dust and debris before applying the product.  If you want protection and prefer a matte finish for your iPhone 5 screen, this product should work well for you.
0.96028644	0.77196985	simple application instructions, and it went on like a snap. After a month of use everything is still all well.
0.88872373	0.7330366	Per the instructions, I installed this screen protector on my new phone.  I only experience one small bubble that I can't seem to get rid of, but all in all it is great.  I love that it is ant-glare and it doesn't take anything away from viewing all sorts of things on the screen of my new iphone.
0.9467817	0.83756757	"I was familiar with this brand, having put one on my Kindle Fire 8.9"".  For some reason, I wasn't happy with that install due to a few bubbles remaining.  For this price, though, I decided to try it again for my newly acquired iPhone5.  I have to admit I consider myself a semi-pro at installing these because I used to work for a graphics company that created decals for aircraft, so I was familiar with the application process since installing the decals and these are very similar.  Unlike the Kindle Fire install, this one worked perfectly. I think the size fits perfectly and the holes lined up as expected.  After a few swipes of my finger, I got used to the feel of having a screen protector there and now I can't even tell the difference.The key to installing these are threefold:  make sure to clean your screen thoroughly, clean it again even if you think it's clean, and be patient.  In the beginning, only remove about two inches of the 1st removal plastic cover.  This allows just enough area to fold down and touch the 'sticky piece' to the screen to line it up.  It also allows you to rest the protector on the phone without it sticking - because only about 2 inches should be touching.  Do not try to remove the entire thing at once - it will not work that way.  Not only will you get fuzzies/dirt on it, but lining it up is almost impossible.  Then, when it's lined up, be confident (but not overzealous) and slowly pull the rest of the removal piece off while using the 'squeegee' to lay it flat so no bubbles appear.The bad part is you really get one shot without having dirt stuck to the sticky part.  The good part is if you're patient and go slowly, then it should be ok.  Good luck.By the way, I have dropped my phone (by accident) and it's landed on the screen side.  I don't have any scratches with this protector.  Definite 5 star product so far."
0.9952751	0.804466	I love the matte finish and anti-glare. It is worth buying. You can't beat the price. The quality is very good.
0.41645962	0.63901126	I have purchased other screen protecters (in 3s and 4s) and was disappointed. NEVER buy anything in bulk because you will not be getting quality, just quantity. The adhesive is very strong and the privacy screen works like it is supposed to!
0.9953146999999999	0.8228903000000001	This is my third iPhone, so this is my third kind of screen protectors I've tried.  These were by far the easiest I've used.  Went on great the first time without any lint or bubbles.  If you follow the instructions, you shouldn't have any problems.  And, if you do have a problem the first time, there are two extras to give it another shot.  I just put it on yesterday, so I can't comment on how it performs over time, but so far so good.
0.99445415	0.8617275	These are excellent screen protectors. For the price, they are really a &#34;best in class&#34; item.The key to any screen protector adhering well is too slave at getting any and all lint or debris off of the screen. Just spend a good 10 minutes getting it perfectly clean and gunk-free. It will pay off in droves.It's fully transparent and the screen is still very responsive.
0.8115728	0.69933987	"First of all, let me say I have had numerous touch-screen devices on which I installed screen protectors so I'm not unfamiliar with the process. In fact, some members of my family will bring their devices and protectors to me to install because I'm normally able to install them with very few bubbles.Having said all that, I struggled to get these screen protectors installed with minimal bubbles. The first attempt was such a disaster I ended up having to throw that protector away. I had better luck with the second one but there are still more bubbles than I would like. Sometimes in life you have to say ""good enough"" and that's what I decided here. I've kept the third protector as a backup in case the bubbles continue to irritate me or the second protector is damaged.The product is, in my opinion, ""good enough"" but it is by no means easy to install with a polished looking result. I would only recommend these screen protectors if you can be satisfied with less than perfection."
0.98056567	0.7965646	These installed pretty easily and work great. The anti glare feature is pretty cool and they hold up really well
0.17366481	0.5660733	I bought this because I have previously bought screen protectors from tech armor for my iPod nano and the quality was good, however the ones I received for my 2 iPhones 5 were not the same brand, were so much thinner, and the round cutout for the home button fell off in the middle of the screen protector ruining my first one, the second was so thin that any little imperfection while applying it would ruin the edge of the protector, overall I was disappointed with the quality of the protector which was not nearly as good as the iPod nano's screen protectors :(
0.97577775	0.80700934	I've been searching for decent iPhone screen protectors for two years.  This is it.  Truly anti-glare and no smudge.  I was amazed.  Now, if they were only easier to put on.  Although this screen protector is easier to put on than most, it's a little like brain surgery for me.  Lining it up takes a lot of light and a lot of squinting but I defy you to get on one without an air bubble due to almost invisible specs of dust.  I clean and I clean.  I then use compressed air but it's almost impossible.  That said I did a 95% satisfaction installation with this screen protector.  The matte finish is just easier to work with.  It looks like it's going to last a long time so the three I purchased will probably be the last for my iPhone 5 since I upgrade every cycle.  Whatever is coming next I'm sure there will be a Tech Armor screen protector.
0.82806677	0.71997595	The protector works well and was easily installed once I went on-line to see the demonstration on installation. It is doing its job well after 3 weeks.
0.21687445	0.5336549	The first screen protector started lifting at the bottom immediately. I blamed myself and after a couple of months I applied the 2nd one yesterday. I cleaned the screen completely, applied the screen protector and let it sit overnight without touching it. This morning I looked and it is lifting again at the side. I have pressed it down with the little tool they sent, but it keeps lifting. I paid more because Tech Armor had such good reviews, but I am very disappointed.Tech Armor sent a new set of protectors. The 2nd set is working better. Not perfect, but much better.
0.567409	0.5339302	Only put it on if you know what you're doing! Or else you're not going to get the FULL range of features it has. Really like it, but one problem is it smudges, bad. But then again which clear screen doesn't? Great product over all.
0.989956	0.8573438	This screen fit my iPhone 5 perfectly and is non-glossy so supposed to cut down on glare outdoors. Took a little bit of concentration to try not to get air bubbles trapped but of course all screens are hard to apply perfectly. Overall, this one is better than the others I've tried on other phones.
0.981146	0.78290904	Very satisfied with the cling, clarity, and overall quality of this screen protector. Purchased to install on two IPhone 5s. Was able to install successfully on one but ended up ruining the remaining 2 while trying to install on the second phone. Contacted Tech Armor customer service and received courteous response with no questions asked. They sent me a free replacement as promised with free shipping. These guys are the best!
0.9258354999999999	0.6962414000000001	Very easy with the instructions and dust cloth that come with the item.Even bought another set to have on hand.
0.9924933000000001	0.71456534	package arrived as advertised, easy to apply to my iphone 5 and will use it again in the future when needed.
0.9783915000000001	0.6041141999999999	I got this product because I needed the anti-glare.  It's great, just what I needed.  Installation was good but make sure you follow the directions.  Go to he web site and look a the video on how to apply the screen protector.
0.034498513	0.39164627	The screen protector is designed to apply from the bottom of the phone to the top. This makes getting the camera and speaker openings aligned almost impossible. I was unsuccessful at getting this protector applied correctly.
0.9955785	0.8092772	It was relatively easy to put on, inexpensive, and works great. I can't even tell there is a screen protector on my iphone.
0.07176408	0.5090260999999999	"First, the included polish cloth consistently leaves small bits of dust on the screen when you polish. I spent 5 min carefully removing each bit of debris until I thought the screen was lint free. When I applied the screen protector, I immediately found out one piece of lint remained as it was now stuck between the screen protector and my phone's screen. One screen down, 2 to go. On the second application I learned my lesson.Second, the 2nd ""remove me"" sticker is extremely difficult to remove cleanly. It leaves the sticky residue and even parts of the sticker itself still attached to my phone.I would give it less stars but the screen itself, once applied works. But IMO, the ""tools"" for the application process are horrible. To TechArmor - make a better, lint-free cloth and make sure you can actually remove the 2nd remove me sticker without it leaving crap on the screen."
0.92742735	0.89316773	So I just got my iPhone 5 and wanted to put on a screen protector.  I am using the Speck Candy Shell Grip as the case and its really protects the rest of the phone very well but of course the screen is exposed.  I had tried Zagg as well as some cheap protectors on other phones and never really satisfied. I also was looking seriously at the GlassT model, as well as the liquid protectors which claim to be quite good.The GlassT is very nice but it adds enough height that my case wont work with it so I ruled it out.  The Zagg didn't have a great feel to it so ruled that out.  I found the Tech Armor here and saw quite a lot of positive reviews..  The price was right, plus you get three so even if you mess up, you have another shot or two.So I procrastinated for a while but finally took the plunge today and installed it.  First, the fit was very good.  The plastic fits the phone face very well so no overhanging edges.  Lineup of the upper earpiece slots wasn't perfect but good enough.  I made sure the home button as well as the sides were perfect.I used a method I saw on YouTube which shows you how to place the protector on the screen, line it up then use a couple of pieces of tape to hold one side, opposite the side you will expose.  That keeps it from moving and then you simply pull the adhesive tab cover off.  Have to say that the protector seemed to really work almost by itself once adhesive was free.  I do have one small dust spot near top and the bottom right corner edge isn't 100% stuck, but overall the fit and adhesion is very good.As for the clarity and touch feel, I think they are well above average.  Hardly any difference in the clarity of Retina display and sensitivities of touch.So since this is first day, I cannot speak for durability but considering I have the other two still as spares, I am comfortable that this was a very good value.Take your time and clean the screen and try the scotch tape method, seems to be a nice way to keep it exactly in place while exposing the adhesive.I doubt I will try to use the lifetime warranty since I am sure some shipping costs will be involved but even if it lasts only a few months, I am still good for a year of protection at a small price.
0.08906132	0.41286838	I got the screen protector to fit on perfectly, however, the open holes for the camera and the speaker are off. It's not centered. Even by raising it up to look at the screen protector itself you can tell that it's not centered. I looked at all three of them and they were the same. I dont like it and it's annoying me.
0.95976835	0.7791899999999999	not much to say except the product does what its supposed to...stays in place....keeps front screen clean....would recommend to anyone......it works....really!!!
0.087296754	0.4949017	The protector was easy to install but it shows fingerprints and is not easily cleaned.  The price was all right but I was disappointed with the screen protector itself.  I would opt for a matte finish in my next purchase.
0.88856333	0.7653946	I just got a upgrade from my cell provider so it was time to go alittle high tech the device the Iphone5  im 73yrs and no gadget geek by any strecth but my kids and grandkids said get it. still not sure how to really use it but i can make a phone call and view family photos. Being old school i take care of what i have. the screen is the most used part thats where i began. Not knowing much  about these i read reviews and thats why i am doing this as well i recieved my order quickly and these have  lifetime replacement which i dont expect to use lol but the seller has a link that shows you the proper way to install and maintain the screen protecter which in my case was very helpful ive never done one before but it is pretty simple the other two i dont ill ever use i carry this phone in my jacket pocket sometimes with my keys and other pocket junk and it still looks great my eyes arent the greatest but the matte finish was a certain plus if your alittle hard on your toys protect them TECH ARMOR great product great price with good support as well hope this helped youRickPs.Shortly after i sent this out i was contacted by the Seller thanking me for the review the real fact is you cant dispute the name TECH ARMOR. I wouldnt replace it with anything else Retired NYFD 37yrs i know tough Happy holidays Rick
0.9961535	0.8046472	I don't like case on my phone, with iphone 5 display not as stong as iphone 4 i got scratches within few days so i decided to go with screen protector and it worked out well. amazing quality and lifetime replacement warranty is outstanding worth for money. very good quality, must have it..
0.9925083	0.82004154	I've used a few different brands. These are super clear and go on easily. The lint pick-up tape that they include is genius. I had one mess-up, and they happily sent me another package! Follow the instructions, mind the static electricity and you'll have great results
0.9309617	0.7189727	I bought this one along with the HD ones. Although I had a tough time installing it, the final one finally installed to where it has no bubbles. I like the fact that they're the only screen protectors that go around the entire home button and the speaker. They're a bit tougher than Invisible Shield which seem to stretch. I contacted their customer support and they sent me some free screen protectors after giving me some advice on how to install them to replace the one I had with bubbles.
0.017093927	0.36794335	Had the screen protector on my phone for 1 week and it is already bubbling up. Never has this happen with any other screen protector. Very disappointed.
0.36590916	0.62493324	Not clear,  Takes away the color and clarity of the display by 25%-30% (in my opinion).  I compared it with my brothers Iphone 5 which has the Halo screen protector made in Japan and it was cheaper in price too.  Tech Armor Screen Protector is design in USA but made in China. All of the design went into the packaging not so much the product (in my opinion:)Update:  I got a replacement from the anti-glare to the HD Clear ones.  Great customer support.
0.45669	0.49306676	I find the screen protector does the job exactly as promised! I wonder why the phones are not marketed with this screen protector already affixed.
0.7075055	0.7221753000000001	I would suggest going with the non-matte version. I accidentally purchased the matte version and it's difficult to see the screen in certain lighting. I also feel it dulls the great iphone5 screen. While it's hard to complain given the price, I would go with the non-matte 'Premium HD' version if I had a choice since they're the same price.
0.94256365	0.43271235	I am very happy that I purchased the Tech Armor for my Apple iPhone.  It serves its purpose.  Thank you!
0.58599573	0.6569871	The product is true to it's description.  I placed the screen protector on my phone with no bubbles.  The only issue I have is that the screen protector is a tad smaller than the iPhone5 itself so there's a little gap on the right side of my phone that the protector doesn't cover, but it's a good product.
0.9462594999999999	0.7298365	i was not really sure if should spent this much money but this was totally worth it and fits perfectly
0.90166974	0.7399384	Keeps your phone safe from scratches dirt and dust, will buy another set for the long life of my touchscreen
0.9357511999999999	0.7867607	Fits perfectly without air bubbles very first time, unlike my previous experiences where I had to use all 3 in the pack. Also, I find additional tape to remove dust particles, which seems to be an improvement by Tech Armor. Overall, I am very satisfied with packing, instructions and product itself. Only flaw I see is that the protector is actually a couple of millimeters smaller than the screen, not sure if it is actually flaw or intentional. Anyway, I don't care as that gap is now covered with the Belkin Grip Candy Sheer Case / Cover.
0.0141246915	0.40257016	I am not too happy of the fit of the film on the phone. The holes are off and the whole film does not cover the whole screen. I had to readjust to fit all camera, speaker and menu button and as a result bubbles started developing. I am not happy at all.
0.9896344000000001	0.7946273	I got two sets of screen protectors for my Iphone 4 and Iphone 5. I am really impressed by their quality and presentation. The package includes everything that you need to fix the screen protectors on the screen. Especially the tape to remove the dust particles from the screen is a great idea and I really appreciate that. The video on the website of Tech Armor is also helpful in the process.
0.95478475	0.76814365	You can't even tell it's there most times. I wish it were a little more smudge resistant, but that's always the trade off between screen clarity and fewer smudges. I would recommend these if you want your screen to look its best
0.8814386000000001	0.5504398	I recently purchased ipad screen protectors from tech armor. Installation was a cinch. I think they're officially my go-to brand for screen protection.
0.97567236	0.755339	I like the matte finish screen protectors much better than the clear ones. (personal taste)This was the first protector I was able to apply with out having to do it 2 times before I got it perfect!
0.99487096	0.82691467	Everything about this screen protector was convenient. It arrived quickly, was simple to apply, and fits nicely. The screen for the iPhone 5 is pretty scratch-resistant in the first place, but I like that this helps mask fingerprints a little better. I haven't noticed that the colors or display have been compromised by this much. Significantly reduces glare on the screen when outdoors in the sun. I am very pleased with the product so far.
0.35699509999999995	0.3983943	Great screen protector, never smudges. I do not like the appearance of the earpiece and camera cutouts, but it's not a deal breaker.
0.99612117	0.827332	Chose the anti-glare and could not be happier. Works exactly as expected and was relatively simple to put on. Would recommend to anyone looking for a screen protector .
0.9252621999999999	0.78399307	I was due for a phone upgrade December 2011. My old 3GS was broken so my go-to was a cheap go phone while I patiently waited for the iPhone 5 to be released. Once the phone came out I waited even longer so that I could obsess over having all the proper protection in place for it before actually touching it.TheTech Armor screen protector was extremely high rated by an obscene amount of reviewers, so naturally it became my screen protector of choice as well. Now that all pieces are in place--phone here and activated, case here and on, and screen protector tight and straight--I am in love! Tech Armor has designed a protector that is virtually imperceptible to my fingers and eyes. In addition to that, all the cut-outs are precise/spot on! Assembly was a cinch...first try was the only one needed. Don't over think it, take a second to glance at the instruction sheet, and apply. Enjoy.
0.99299824	0.8585326999999999	Super easy to install, no bubbles at all, shows absolutely no oils or finger prints.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I even bought the ipod 5 protectors.
0.46097952	0.5427189	OK, I have been down this road before with my previous iPhone 4.  So just got the new iPhone 5 and once again I wanted to put a screen shield over the glass display.  Got the Tech Armor 3 pack and read the instructions.  Then went to the website and watched the video a couple of times.  The video made the installation process look simple and straightforward.  Great !  First I super-cleaned the glass display.  Second, I placed the phone on the stove with the vent pulling air up on high.  Check.  Third, get shield #1 out and take deep breath and start the process.  Align by the edge of the phone by the home button and then unwrap the shield up to the top of the phone.  But ... by the time I got to the top of the phone, the shield was seriously  mis-aligned.  I quickly diagnosed my problem:  namely that if the alignment at the home button edge of the phone is off by just a millimeter, by the time you get the shield to the top of the phone, that mis-alignment is several millimeters - and you have to discard that shield.  On my third attempt, by some miracle I got it aligned pretty close, but still had one dust particle trapped under the middle (!) of the shield.Bottom line:  it might be me (see title of review), but the installation process is quite difficult to complete perfectly - which is what I was shooting for.  Don't think Tech Armor shields are flawed.  But I do think there has to be a better, easier way to install a screen shield.  I just have not found it yet.Better luck than I had with your installation !
0.25850454	0.50055456	It does not fit well - while it does not block anything, the holes do not match well, and the whole thing is too small to cover an iPhone 5 from edge to edge. Due to this, it bubbles/peels at the edges.  Customer service said they will send me replacements but it's been weeks and NO replacements yet.  Also, no response from support too.Update:  Customer service finally responded after I posted this review and also shipped me replacements.
0.9750074000000001	0.79892206	I asked my friend to put the matte screen protector on my iphone as he succeed to put a clear one on his iphone (from Tech Armor too) on his first try.He used my whole set (3) and wasn't able to put it correctly. I emailed the customer service and they sent me a new set right away. With the new set, I was able to put it right on my first try very easily and no bubbles.So far, no scratches, no fingerprints and very good quality.Updated: after a month of use, I have 2 big scratches on it. I only put my iphone in my pocket and always make sure that I have no keys or anything in it. I never dropped my iphone so I have no idea where those scratches come from.  I'm going to put a new one and hope that this one will last longer than a month. So far still no fingerprints (yeah) but some scratches :(
0.95157135	0.74669904	Comes in pack of 3 with all the little things you would need to a successful install like squeegee, cleaning cloth and dust removal tape. Very good instructions and video on the companies web site if you need it. Went on easily and works as intended. Once it's on you do not even notice it's there. I am using it with the LUVVITT Clearview case and you can't even tell it's not a bare iphone.
0.87847704	0.8507068000000001	"The case is protective, while not being awkward and bulky. It's a very nice design, the hard case, covered by the soft one. It also has a rubbery texture that is almost ""tacky"". It really helps to grip the phone, especially when answering quickly out of your pocket.Also a very affordable price. It's nice when you don't always get what you pay for!"
0.007832885	0.5245422	Followed directions and installed on two new iPhones.  Had so many bubbles we took them off after two days paid the Sprint store to install theirs which work great!  Fortunately not a waste of a lot of money and a lesson learned.
0.99851966	0.8428408000000002	Follow the instructions and the screen protector goes on with no problems. It fits perfectly and you cannot tell that anything is on the screen. Excellent product.
0.8234357	0.7503718	Perfect! easy to install, and with 3 in the package Im sure I wont need any more!  I had one that came with the otterbox and that was shiny, collected fingerprints and began coming off at the corner after only a few months.  Anti fingerprint, anti glare- the way to go!  I might share one of the screen protectors with my boyfriend. ;)
0.9884335999999999	0.69374263	excellent fit for my iphone 5 i had some problems with getting screen on right but the there customer service was reaaly great and offered to send me a free set thanks tech armor
0.98811686	0.77378476	This was simple to apply, looks great and I am quite certain it will be around for a long time.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a shield to protect their phone.
0.90781736	0.67559355	Installs easily.  Only one bubble (my fault) and it's tiny.  Can't imagine a phone without one.  Especially the fingerprint part.
0.98056805	0.77715844	Bought this several weeks ago and finally put it on an iPad 2 and iPhone 5. The application was easy. As always, start with a clean, dustless device. As with all anti-glare products, there's a slight loss of screen clarity. That being said, this is a great product. I'm going to install one on my wife's phone.
0.99857014	0.8332341000000001	have used these on several iphones and ipads now.Clarity, scratch resistance, price and ease of installation are all Excellent!A very exceptional product.
0.96693236	0.74446356	Easy to apply.No air bubbles . Follow instruction insert .Easy way to apply evenly if start from round button .
0.6307446	0.61468863	To be honest, when i first ordered it, i didnt think it would be that much of a screen. Actually better than I thought. Barely see any finger prints, nicely fits. Recommend buying.
0.59635234	0.6765001	I found the product to fit nicely, and presume will protect the phone for relatively minor accidents not involving the screen. But I was disappointed in the product's &#34;feel&#34; - I personally  prefer a slightly softer more &#34;rubbery&#34; feel (as opposed to its smooth-plastic feel) to provide more confident handling. But the price is good.
0.62327504	0.6925268	Easy to stick onto my iPhone 5's screen and works fine under my OtterBox Defender's built in screen protector. Great buy!The one annoying thing about the privacy screen is that it tends to make my phone's display more difficult to see in sunlight.
0.99411595	0.71317816	I wanted a very clear screen protector and I so happy I found this product. It also came with 3 so that was nice too. Good price, great product
0.8744271	0.68377805	Be sure to follow the instructions exactly. I did not have the patience initially, and wasted one of the three included screen protectors. I then outsourced the task to someone more slow and cautious, and it turned out great! Totally worth it to spend a few bucks to have basic screen protection for your iPhone 5.
0.9606931000000001	0.85919523	The Tech Armor HD Screen Protector for the iPhone 5 work as advertised. The product fits nicely with the cutouts for the home button & ear speaker in the correct location. I have not noticed any problems with the sensitivity of the touch screen with the protective screen on the phone. In fact, the screen is really not noticeable at all. Installing the protector is relatively easy. Just be sure you are placing the correct side of the film to the phone. I would recommend the purchase of this product as it is a well made product at a reasonable price.
0.91596377	0.7550872	I purchased this for my iPhone 5 and the Techarmor HD protector for my wife's iPhone 4.  I'm not sure why anyone would use one of these at it badly blurs your retina display and really bothered my eyes when reading emails or text messages.  I will say it's very easy to install.  The one for the iPhone 4 also went on great and isn't noticeable at all.  I'm going with the HD protector for the iPhone 5 now.
0.5262741	0.673053	I bought both the iPhone 5 and the iPad screen protectors. The iPhone protector was easy to install and went on without a hitch. I cleaned with the enclosed microfiber cloth, then blew the screen free of dust with compressed air. Staying away from my desk which seems to draw a lot of dust, due to the papers around the office, I was able to get the protector on without any dust spots or bubbles.The iPad protector was a different story, though. I guess the sheer size makes a lot of difference. I was able to get alost perfect results, but not quite. a few dust specks remain.The disappointment comes from the protector material. It is easy to smear up and difficult to clean. All fingerprints and swipes show up and are distracting. I have tried to clean with the microfiber cloth, a lens cleaning cloth, and Windex spray on a paper towel. the Windex does the best job, but the screen protector is still smeary. I think there must be some brand of better quality that won't smear so badly.
0.06461006400000001	0.37273455	I bought this product for my IPhone 5 and the product does not stick very well and the one that did stick you can't get the bubbles out.
0.9979302999999999	0.84889644	Tech Armor shields are great!  They protect the phone, are easy to fit, easy to see through and work great with the touch disply.  I will always have these on my iPhones.
0.007606386999999999	0.5326320999999999	Very thin, tried all three without any success, too thin to apply properly. Will not be using this brand anymore.
0.99437845	0.8160394	Ever since I bought the iPhone 3GS when it first came out, I've always purchased PowerSupport screen protectors for my iPhones. After getting my iPhone 5, I got tired of waiting for them to produce a screen protector, and I stumbled across the Tech Armor protector. After using it for a month, I can honestly say I couldn't be happier. Easy to install, no bubbles, crystal clear film, and it doesn't seem to scratch easily. It looks just as good now as it did when I put it on...Tech Armor has a new loyal customer!
0.9012877	0.7806728000000001	I love these screen protectors. Not only are they anti-glare but the anti-fingerprint really does help. Plus it just feels cool. Thick enough to protect the phones screen too.My only tip to you if you plan on buying this: Make sure you are in a clean environment when installing it. Make sure your hands are clean and you use the cleaning cloth they provide to make sure the screen is clean. One little chunk of dust will bug you forever!!BUY THESE!
0.059785128	0.47304678	The screen protector is easy enough to put on, however I was disappointed at how imprecise the cutouts for the camera and speaker are. They are too large and are off center on the phone. The protector is also smudges very badly.
0.0025745332	0.4021976	Again bad product!!!! Do not purchase!! Leaves air bubbles even after being pushed out, and leaves dust even after the instructions were followed! Not happy with purchase at all
0.9566816999999999	0.632024	Having the options of the screen protectors is nice so you can decide when you get them, which is best for your situation.
0.9984430000000001	0.81431127	This product fits very well, also is easy to put, also the product arrived very fast. Recommended to iPhone 5.
0.98754084	0.7380230999999999	I you ever had the feeling that someone was watching what you were doing on your cell phone, this is perfect because its stealth ability..... people will have to be up on you to see what you're doing. especially from an angle.I love it.
0.9892409	0.7196039000000001	This is a very smooth screen protector.Easy instalation and nice anti-glare system!!I would recomend this product to anyone!!
0.07386011	0.4055487	Work better than any one I have tried .no bubbles. Once installed you don't even know it's there.... Just buy one
0.98662055	0.88321686	I like these Tech Armor anti-glare screen protectors.  Mine went on with almost zero bubbles; just a couple of tiny ones right at the edge where they are unnoticeable.  The anti-glare characteristics of this product are good -- it really does cut glare while not inhibiting visibility or brightness of the screen in any way.  I also like the touch texture of this protector; it has a very nice feel for your finger when using touch-screen.  This is a good deal for the money and works well.  RJB.
0.9863608	0.73464656	I will do business with this co.again. Product is as advertised, easy to install, and works as advertised. Video demonstration is on website. all you have to do is watch and install.
0.76447105	0.483878	This is a good buy. Although I bought an otterbox that has a built in screen protector, I did try it and used it just the same.
0.38713476	0.60636085	This is a nice protector, with good instructions and the necessary materials to install it. I sort of failed on the first try because I didn't understand that there is a protective sheet on each side of the protector. The pull tab wouldn't come off of the second sheet so I thought it was a defect. The mfg helped me on this so now I see it as an easy installation.
0.8573519000000001	0.79558545	I had no troubles lining it up on my screen. works exactly like it claims, anti glare and fingerprint. I would recommend this to anyone its a cheap easy way to protect your screen and you dont have to constantly clean the smudge marks off the screen.
0.9875695	0.85385716	This is probably the easiest screen protector to apply out there. It is a solid plastic type material so it is easy to apply unlike the soft films out there. And it doesn't leave any air bubbles. I am no pro at applying these and have had trouble getting air bubbles in other screen protectors but not with these. I am on my second one in the 3 pack and the first one lasted about 8 months before it had too many scratches in it for me to be comfortable with. Best thing was, when I took it off, the iphone screen was still in pristine condition! Negates all glare and have never had a fingerprint on one at all. I am definitely going to keep buying these for my future phones! Pay the extra couple bucks for quality screen protectors because it will be the one thing you come into contact with most everyday.
0.98643833	0.7465222	Recieved my screen protectors today and immediately applied it on my iPhone 5! It fit PERFECT!! And I can't even see it on the sides, almost like it's part of the phone. I love it!!
0.1395225	0.38139316	I like the anti glare look of this screen but was having a hard time applying it to an iPhone 5. That's just operator error, nothing to do with the manufacturing.Good product, and it comes with two more so if something goes awry, I have back up.
0.5791708999999999	0.449643	I'm waiting for Tech Armor iPhone 5S / iPhone 5C / iPhone 5 4-Way, 360 Degree, Privacy Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [1-Pack] - Retail Packaging
0.582915	0.7306020000000001	"Installation was easy and quick. The ""Ultimate 4-Way 360 Degree Privacy"" is only true if the phone is held at 150 degrees or more from the person next to you. All this thing does is make your screen darker and blurry. Anyone can still read and see what you're doing on your phone if they are sitting next to you. Very disappointed with this purchase. I have seen much much better privacy screen at Big Lots for $5. Will be returning it promptly."
0.9023434000000001	0.7336821	Someone finally got a screen cover right.  It goes on smooth with just a few bubbles that are easily pressed out.  I am ordering one for my iPad.
0.9998895000000001	0.8922551999999999	outstanding,very good&excellent product. Very satisfied with the screen protectors they were very easy to apply. definitely recommend this to anybody out there looking for quality at a very affordable price without compromising protection and style.
0.79924107	0.6982468000000001	Works like a charm BUT MAKE SURE you look carefully at the &#34;Remove Me&#34; labels.  They each have a number on them (1 or 2) but it is very small.  If you inadvertanly peel off the #2 side and put it on the phone and proceed through the instructions, once you peel off the #1 side and expose it to the environment, you might as well throw it away.  (I was in a hurry and did just that... Learn from my mistake.)  When done correctly it works great!Only suggestion to Tech Armor... make the miniscule #1 and #2 bigger.  Like perhaps the size of the words &#34;Remove Me&#34;.  Better yet... &#34;Remove Me FIRST&#34;  and Remove Me LAST&#34; would be a fool proof improvement.  Guess I was just a fool.
0.9879226000000001	0.7331156	Great product! I use it on my IPhone and my IPad. I even have the rest of my family using them.
0.84727013	0.7342811	The install was very easy.  The few bubbles that were there went away when I used the card and cloth (as in the video).The only things that look funny are the holes for the ear speaker and camera are more 'wide, to the left' than they need to be.  The right side lines up perfectly, but they extend farther to the left than they need to.
0.49777013	0.507147	Bought and applied the product. Just keep your work area and phone clear of dust. Prefer the matte film for less smudge on the phone.
0.9986091999999999	0.88226056	I tried putting this on my phone without reading the directions first and I got a lot of air bubbles. The great thing is that you get more than one,so I read the directions and tried again and it went on perfectly. It looks great and doesn't affect the touch screen capability! I'd definitely recommend this item to people.
0.9770485000000001	0.8868688	The screen protector has just enough thickness to make it very easy to apply. Very few bubbles that resolve themselves quickly. Didn't even need the squeegee to smooth it out. Because it is a nonglare screen protector it does have some graininess but far less than any others  I've tried. Clear graphics and vibrant colors. Very smooth swiping your finger across the screen and it truly is fingerprint resistant. I'll definitely try out Tech Armor's HD, clear screen protector too.
0.9205804	0.74412215	I purchased the matte finish anti glare screen protectors. I really like the feel of the matte texture and they make a huge difference when using the phone in direct sunlight.
0.4807527	0.72501993	This screen protector came on time and was easy to apply. However be aware that (a) it has a back that pulls off and the rest goes directly on the phone (I am used to having two pull-off parts - the second after you put it on the phone) and (b) it is anti-glare but you lose the nice bright screen that is a feature of the Iphone 5. So to get anti-glare, you give up clarity of the screen. In addition, it is not completely anti-fingerprint but better than some others.
0.9793744000000001	0.72089535	Great screen protector and I just only did once. No bubbles, no anything without that spray thing. So easy to apply and in case you do not do it right, you still have 2 more extras. And what i appreciate most is the package was well-prepared and took only 2 days to get here.
0.86995053	0.7216545999999999	Installation was easy following directions provided.  The protectors allow cleaning of the display without fear of scratching the screen.  The protectors do not inhibit viewing the screen.
0.9192654	0.71705407	1 word the most awesome this is got to be the best screen protector up to put it on was not even one little flaw
0.9993042999999999	0.88232785	I've been using screen protectors for quite some time now. Back in the day it was for iPhone 3GS, then iPhone 4, iPad, Kindle, DLSR's and now recently is for iPhone 5 and let me tell you, Tech Armor is by far the best screen protector I've come across for the quality, fitting and the things they included in the package.It comes with:1) three piece screen protector2) lint removing polishing cloth3) Dust Removal Tape (this is new, very helpful and not everyone gives one)4) Credit Card sized/shaped card board for application and bubble removal - works great!5) and of course step by step installation instructions booklet - very helpful for the first timersOverall the process was easy, the protector fits great on the front of the phone and feels great. You literally cannot make out if anything has been applied on the phone. I loved it! and not to mention, what a great price!!!
0.9922283000000002	0.793603	Awesome product, beats product that are 4 times the money.  I paid for a screen cover on my phone that was $25 and had to be installed at the store.  It stayed on for a month.  This cover is great.
0.9981705	0.7370331999999999	This product was by far the easiest, and most successful experience with screen protectors we have ever had. Highly recommended!
0.5535925	0.72695583	So as far as screen protection, this seems to work and hold up fine. My wife and I have both put this on our iphone 5 and it fits great. The problem is with screen resolution. If you go on a screen with a white background, you get this glittery effect. It's hard to describe but when the screen protector is removed, it's like you have a brand new phone and everything is sharper. Perhaps it's the matte finish that's causing it. I'm not sure what to buy next but it won't be this one again.
0.98378277	0.7459938	Good antiglare, fairly easy to apply. Cut right to size for the iPhone 5. Comes in a pack of 3 and great price!
0.6071104	0.644295	Good screen protector. I would recommend it to anyone. The instructional video on how to apply it was very helpful. However, it attracts fingerprints very easily. I have to constantly wipe it, but then that is typical of the clear protectors.
0.99322957	0.7011350000000001	i love the protecting screen. seems to make my screen look clearer? I would recommend this to family and friends.
0.006559580600000001	0.6122548000000001	When I bought this, I had read the reviews and was excited to try it. When I put it on, it fit perfectly to my iPhone. Unfortunately, after three days, it began to peel off and wouldn't stick to my phone anymore.
0.7787539000000001	0.7798911000000001	does exactly what it's supposed to.  it looks and feels like there is nothing on the screen.  the cut outs are perfectly placed and it was very easy to install.  got it on the first try with no dust or bubbles trapped underneath.my only drawback is that it shows every fingerprint.  i had a screen protector on my old 4s that had a matte finish that prevented fingerprints and glare, but this isn't made that same way.  the plus side to the glossy finish however is that the screen looks a lot clearer and crisper, so it's not completely bad.  just a preference thing,
0.99254364	0.81544137	this tech armor screen saver for my iPhone 5 was a very good purchase. it went on easy and is not noticeable on. does not hinder finger movement sliding on screen. love it. thanks for an excellent product
0.99862456	0.86244535	This screen protector fits well and was easy to apply using my stove vent to prevent dust particles during application.  Good value.
0.99909854	0.7928735	Hands down the best screen protector I've bought. I'm on my 3rd iphone and this product is excellent. Highly recommend!
0.42608008	0.61636305	After installing it, the clarity of the screen was affected and small fonts that used to be clear became fuzzy so I had to remove it and throw it away.
0.9926640999999999	0.7325321	Exactly what I was hoping for! I am happy I purchased the screen protector for my iPhone 5... It fits perfectly on the screen :)
0.99387527	0.8112724	Minimal cost for three easy to use screen protectors, which arrived promptly. Loved the visual as well as written directions.
0.94694954	0.6486656	It protect your fancy iphone 5 screen, if you want the protector to mesh quiet well you need to take your time and do a nice job sticking it.
0.9895494	0.7450354	I love this screen protector.  It fits my new iPhone5  perfectly.  Not too hard to install, though it took me 3 tries.  That was my fault, though.  Read the directions carefully and watch the video on their website and you are good to go.  The non glare feature is really cool, too.  All in all a great screen protector.  I would buy it again for sure.
0.98217136	0.7838358	Not much to say: it's affordable and it looks great.  Doesn't degrade the quality of the iPhone 5's screen; actually I can hardly tell it's on.  Application is quick and easy.
0.8806777	0.6537630999999999	I had the antiglare from a differnt manufacture, which had issues with respose time. I liked these better since it feels like the actual glass and response is fast.
0.9784398999999999	0.7256706999999999	I hated the protector that came with my case and when I found this I ordered immediately.  No glare, no fingerprints and best of all, no bubbles when you're putting it on the phone.  Great product and I already recommended to a family member.
0.9458885	0.76113296	I managed to go through all three protectors in one shot the day after I received my new phone, finally getting the last one on perfectly.  Loved it once it was on.  THEN...found out that I had received a defective iPhone and it needed to be replaced the next day at the Apple store.  Even though this was not Tech Armor's problem per se, I explained the situation to them and they sent out a replacement set of protectors immediately.  I am extremely impressed with their customer service, first and foremost; the product is also a very nice one.
0.98463726	0.7653888000000001	I have had an iPhone 3GS, a 4S, and now a 5. By far, this is the best privacy screen I've ever purchased! It sticks,, is dark to peepers, but you can see well. Bought a duplicate for my hubby.
0.9567874	0.7221601	These are pretty good value.  You get a little more than you pay for here.  They do a good job!
0.99568856	0.7982204	Very easy to install and protects the screen. You can't event tell it's on the phone. Would definitely recommend this product.
0.33835185	0.5723221	After wasting lots of money on different mylar screen protectors for my iPhone 5, I was ready to give up. Trying to apply them without getting annoying bubbles stuck underneath was nearly impossible; they has &#34;rainbow&#34; effects as you tilted the phone; and no matter how clean my hands were, they were always covered with fingerprints. So, based on a friend's recommendation, I tried Tech Armor's matte screen protector. First, if one follows the installation instructions EXACTLY, there are NO BUBBLES! The screen protector is an exact fit, without unprotected areas around the speaker or light cell such as I had with other products. Also, no &#34;rainbows,&#34; and no fingerprints unless you use it with sticky hands. There IS a bit of &#34;scatter&#34; that occurs with detailed images, so that they're not as 100% sharp as they would be with a glossy protector -- but it's a small price to pay, considering all the other advantages.
0.7708782	0.7355816999999999	The screen protector itself is nice. It's clear, feels good, and fits pretty well. I don't like the overly large cutouts for the camera and speaker, but I understand they have a purpose. The protector gathers fingerprints, but that's pretty much unavoidable for clear screen protectors.The only real issue I had with this product was with the cloth they provided. AVOID using it. It got tiny fibers underneath the screen protector when I was using it to clean the screen. A better cloth should have been provided for such a particular application. I applied this to a brand new iPhone 5 in a steam filled bathroom immediately after removing the original plastic so the only source of fibers had to be the provided cloth. I didn't have issues with bubbling, but the little fibers ruined a nice installation.
0.9943991	0.77648926	This screen protector was easy to install and has already proven effective at withstanding my son's toy car attacks.  :)  Great product that I'm glad I purchased.
0.6855873	0.65085703	The product works really well.  Installation wasn't all that easy though.  Although they give you all these items (dust cloth, stickers) to ensure dust-free application I guess my house isn't up to clean room standards because I kept getting annoying little dust bits trapped underneath.  Thank goodness they provide 3 plastic protector sheets though -- third time was the charm for me in a clean installation.
0.97130096	0.8246341999999999	I was not that excited about trying to put this on my phone. In the past I have found these kinds of protectors to be very difficult to correctly line up and install... and usually I just got so frustrated I ended up throwing them away rather than deal with a phone with the screen occluded by bubbles and grime peering through the shield. However, this package comes with three protectors... I guess in case you screw up you can have at least two more chances of getting it right. Well, I finally bit the bullet and decided to attach the shields, reading the directions carefully, I made sure all the needed components were laid out on the desk (flat surface) in front of me. I cleaned the iPhone with the included cloth and then used the sticky sheet of plastic, also included, to make sure all the dust and any remaining particles were removed from my iPhone before applying the shield. I followed the instructions as written and it took about two minutes, if that to apply to my phone. I used the included cardboard scraper to remove the one or two bubbles under the clear plastic shield and that was it. Very easy. Follow the instructions, be patient, make sure your phone is actually clean, and take the time to line it up well before pulling the rest of the backing off and you will be quite pleased with the results. It goes on quite easily. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product!
0.9395294	0.68108547	I bought these screen protectors and thought they may have a defect because of a crazy amount of bubbles. Very conveniently, there was a support email on their website. I contacted it and received no response. I then wrote a three-star review on Amazon, thinking the Lifetime Warranty was a fake. How surprised I was when Tech Armor contacted me just minutes after my review wanting to resolve my issue. I again explained to them my issue and they are now shipping me out a replacement set via UPS First-Class. I am very pleased with their customer service and am proud that I got this product over Zagg (I threatened to go over to Zagg in my previous review but now customer service worked out!) I only rate this four stars because I had to jump through a couple hoops to attain what I hope to be a perfect replacement, and this time I know what to do if the next ones aren't perfect. :)
0.25149745	0.5873086	"I ordered the anti-glare screen protectors, a set of 3, for myself, my father, and my mother.  Two of them installed fine, but the the one I gave to my mom was just impossible to line up correctly.  Upon closer inspection, I realized that the screen protector had not been cut precisely, if the home button hole is aligned, the front facing camera is covered and the ear-speaker are slightly covered.  I tried contacting their customer service, but the guy said that I should just deal with it since ""thorough testing has shown that the screen protector does not interfere with the phone's performance"".  OK, really!? The screen protector should protect and compliment the appearance of the phone; but this faulty one does the exact opposite.Would have been 5 stars if they were willing to just send a replacement, instead of giving me a lousy reason to deal with it."
0.9847176999999999	0.81424737	I just finished applying the Tech Armor screen protector to my iPhone 5. I carefully followed the directions, and carried out the application on the bathroom counter shortly after taking a shower (from a tip that helps keep the dust down). It went on perfectly. Although I slightly misaligned it to begin with, it was easy to adjust it to proper alignment. It looks great and works flawlessly.
0.99815714	0.8205769	Ordered the product and it shipped within one day. It was easy to apply to the phone and i got it on perfectly my second try. Great product for the price and great service by tech armor!
0.16493276	0.40450418	I sent it back cuz it is a matte finish and causes the screen to look pixilated. I'm just going to go to the apple store and buy the good one.
0.24068451	0.42902470000000004	Good scratch protection.It is quite hard to keep bubbles from forming under the film when applying to surface of the iphone.
0.9992795	0.75663733	the best screen protector for iphone,very easy to use,totally love it,price is great for  an awesome product. just love it
0.8999288000000001	0.72861177	These were by far the easiest to apply! I've tried other cheap little brands before and I do a terrible job and the screen protector gets ugly really quickly or I notice my screen isn't as clear and hi def as if should be! I love these and will continue buying their product!
0.99036145	0.7510945	I was very worried about those hideous bubbles when shopping for a screen protector for my new phone as I have screwed up many times in the past applying screen protectors. However, all you gotta do is follow the simple instructions that come with the booklet, even comes with a link to a video; so you really can't get this wrong! Plus comes with the lifetime TechArmor guarantee. I am very satisfied with this product!!
0.9982269	0.73681587	I love it it is like the best thing I ever had. Thank you for the iPhone case it is slim and light and it fits perfectly
0.9956965	0.8476716999999999	Before buying this one, I tried skinomi but it did not turn well on my phone. This one is great, there is no liquid issues to spray on the protector or any such thing. It is very simple and easy to install. I would say watch the video before installation. Thank you tech armor for making it so easy to install by ourselves at home with no problems.
0.9492574	0.78175735	The screen protector went on easy and keeps my iphone from getting lots of fingerprints all over it, which has been a problem for me in the past.  Some might not like the feel of it on the screen, it's night quite as smooth as the natural screen or some other screen protectors, but if you are looking to keep the screen clean and protected, this is the one to go with.
0.9975581	0.69700825	It is a really really good product and the price is reasonable!!! Highly recommend! I love it so so much.
0.92778003	0.80214334	These fit my iPhone 5 like a taylored glove. Leaves the right openings in the earpiece, camera, and light sensor. And goes on smooth once you get the hang of putting it on!
0.06399587	0.33862835	Not a true privacy screen. I can see my screen after I install this screen. Not recommended, buy other brand.
0.9845151	0.86535776	These are indeed tough covers. The site even provides a helpful video for goof-proof installation.  No red tab to remove and no green tab to remove, one of which usually leaves a big smear on your newly applied screen!  The covers are heavier than most I have tried.  I am pleased.
0.95913756	0.77920043	My first attempt to install the product was a complete failure, and I managed to ruin all three shields in the set. However, the Tech-Armor folks sent me a new set of protectors at no charge, and the install went perfectly. Customer Support was very responsive and helpful. Once installed, I can't even tell that my iPhone 5 has a shield on it. Great product.
0.97111845	0.6741798000000001	Buy this product and you won't regret it.. I swear!!!I am so completely satisfied =DIt comes with 3 screen protectors so if you mess up applying it the first time you can do it over again and again.
0.9811318000000001	0.6882669	I haven't used many different screen protectors, so I'm not sure what constitutes greatness...but this one did the job for me.It comes with everything you need to successfully apply in minutes.  I had no bubbles when I was done (which is saying a lot, I'm impatient).  It also comes with extra protectors, which is a big bonus.Very great deal for the price.
0.98067755	0.79184115	The shield was easy to apply, watched the video and had no problems. Did get a few bubbles but was able to push them out with no hassle. Highly recommend product.
0.94041693	0.7470959	A solid product overall. A bit tricky to install but at least you get 3 shots at it. Would recommend.
0.03877434	0.48976928	All but impossible to apply without bubbles.  &#34;Removable&#34; label leaves adhesive residue that needed Goof Off to clean (perhaps this was old stock).
0.9577091999999999	0.5985351999999999	Bought these for my team at the office.  I installed mine and you can't even tell it's there.  Easy to install, but need to take your time.
0.98175174	0.82538915	This screen cover is the best! It absolutely does not show any finger prints or greasy smears. The matte finish is nice and muted...doesn't shine. Highly recommended and this is the only screen protector I would buy again...which might be awhile because I still have 2 extra ones as they come in a 3 pack. The one on the iPhone has been there over 3 weeks and is still flat, no cuts,  no bubbling, no peeling or curling.
0.9852396000000001	0.87792003	I read reviews for the best screen protector on the market and was lead to believe that ZAGG was the best out there. Wrong. The thing was junk! And expensive for just one protector. While the material of the product appears to be quite durable, installation is a pain and the screen resolution is greatly compromised.The second best rated was Tech Armor's and it should be rated first in my book. First off you get three protectors for less than the cost of the one ZAGG. Installation is a breeze and you can make corrections during installation without compromising the products quality. The clarity is ridiculously clear. Almost as if you didn't have one at all. The fit is perfect as well.Follow the instructions as directed and you can't go wrong. And for some reason you screw up and make a mistake, you have a couple more to install. I was able to make it with just one and didn't have a piece of lint or dust under it to deal with.Don't look at any others, just by Tech Armor's.
0.7902583000000001	0.76824665	First attempt to put on was a failure with a lot of frustration.  2nd attempt I was able to get the protector on with a number of air bubbles.  After smoothing out with the junkie cardboard squeegee card I decided to use a plastic credit card to smooth the bubbles out.  This made a difference but I still had a few bubbles at the edges. Make sure you use the cloth under the squeegee card when smoothing the bubbles... this helped.  Overall the screen looks great on my phone...but is the difficulty worth it?  This product is worth its price.
0.99756503	0.8103579000000001	This product is exactly as described. It was easy to put on my phone and arrived a day earlier than expected!!
0.997782	0.8572675	This product works great. It was easy to install and it fits perfectly. The supplied lint free wipe an the sticky back lint remover really helped with making sure the iphone screen was completely clean. The screen protector film looks nice on the screen. It does not interfere with touch screen movement and it helps with glare from the sun and other lights.
0.77086914	0.54631543	Excellent protective film. Word of advice : watch instillation  videos on youtube prior to attempting the instillation in order to avoid simple errors during instillation process. You'll get 3 protective films included in the package.
0.57043266	0.73334765	I like the tech armor covers they are nice I had one that was a higher grade before a miss it. This one does as advertised however getting bubbles out of it was a chore. It has the glossy slick feel to it. It is much better then those crap Korean or Chinese plastic things you can get. Also getting 3 for the 10 buck price is nice too. Over all its a decent product for the price.
0.8990355999999999	0.7683129	I used up all three of the screen protectors trying to get a perfect fit without any bumps, bubbles, or debris under the screen. I guess that isn't a testament to this specific screen protector, since pretty much all screen protectors are very tedious to apply. There has to be a more effective way to install these things, and I'm surprised no one has come up with it.
0.03974819	0.4590617	Wiped the screen as instructed, applied the screen protector as instructed and I still had bubbles underneath. I bought these because they were cheap and came with 3. I have 2 more chances.
0.91826874	0.6269553000000001	good protector, cant even tell its on there. it was real easy to install and there's three of them in case you screw up
0.97460556	0.70618767	Good quality and good price. I would buy it again. Just wish it didnt show fingerprints as much. Over all a good product
0.27977735	0.5848293000000001	Good screen protector, no bubbles at all but this significantly reduced the brightness of my screen even with brightness set to 100%. The matte finish also makes the screen look pixelated. I wished i bought the HD Clear version instead.
0.9870697	0.8923110999999999	I've had a lot of experience with screen protectors (I'm paranoid about scratches) and these are one of the better ones.  I purchased these when the iPhone 5S was first announced and was a little nervous that they might not fit the new fingerprint scanner.  I'm happy to report that the fingerprint reader is the same size as the previous generation's home button and these screen protectors fit the iPhone 5S!These protectors went on very easily.  I'm OCD about lining up the cutouts perfectly so I even lifted the screen protector and re-applied it several times, but it did not affect the ability of these protectors to cling to the screen.  To help prevent dust from gathering on the screen, try applying these in the bathroom with the shower running so the room gets nice and humid (that seems to help the dust to settle down).
0.89090985	0.76787436	Very easy to install.Glossy, should have grabbed the satin or matte finishes if they have them.Bottom hole fits snugly around iPhone button.-1 star for edges around camera hole. Tough to smooth around that area.Would buy again...def.
0.99590194	0.7746563	I love the matte screen protectors. It was exactly what I was looking for. I also bought them because they are anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. Just a great all around screen protector.
0.86071575	0.6878988	It was to hard removing the stickers from the Screen protectors with out damidging them.  The Incipio Dual Pro is perfect!
0.45551974	0.63071	It takes away glare and reduces fingerprints.  For some reason, it seems more difficult to apply properly than the clear protector.
0.9987886999999999	0.8658528	Without exaggeration, this is by far and away the best screen protector out there. It's incredibly easy to apply, and disappears once it's on your phone... you can hardly tell it's even there. An impeccable, outstanding product. I wouldn't buy anything else.
0.9309228999999999	0.7200821	Crips, clear and protective !  Had an install issue but the customer service was excellent and stood by the lifetime warranty...sent out replacement screens at no charge !
0.8188088000000001	0.63713336	Very good product and looks very good on the iphoneone of my screen protectors is missing one of the tabs. I haven't called yet to get a replacement but some people here say it is not a problem and they have a great customer service.
0.99160874	0.7097521	this is probably the best purchase i have made on amazon. it is well worth any price because it is by far the best screen protector i have ever had!
0.95992064	0.7256905	It comes with 3, but I got mine on perfect the 1st try so I have 2 extra for later. You can really see how it takes all the scratches for your phone and it definitely prevents the glare from the sun and fingerprints.  l love it.
0.98657453	0.75260144	I originally bought a screen protector from the AT & T store which cracked in 3 days....waste of $25. Took a chance on this one because you really cant beat the price. Package arrived on time and the shield was very to install. It came with an additional 2 shields for future use which is really a deal considering you only paid a few bucks each. The design and quality are up to par with all the other brands sold at 3-4 times the price at retail stores...which makes you wonder how much markup these stores are doing. You really can't go wrong with these products especially with their prices. I am getting ready to purchase the iPhone case. Review to follow.....
0.82524633	0.75088274	Fits great, not thick at all. My only complaint is that it leaves a lot of fingerprint smudges. But they do come off easily.
0.27477926	0.5008149000000001	I didn't watch the instructional video on how to put it on and wasted two of them:( I watched the video and then tried again, and it worked out perfectly! Its a good, cheap product.
0.5364026	0.46184359999999997	So it came in the mail real quick, but it was the wrong size for the iPhone 5. Returning it was a breeze though. Thanks, Amazon for that.
0.95326495	0.7568362	Worth to spend couple extra buck as compared to low price screen protection. Very slim, I would say its just like one layer of ultra thin paper. Great product.
0.95384514	0.83519197	I received these screen protectors about a week ago and I'm happy with my purchase.  The dusting cloth it came with left lint on my screen unless I rubbed it just right, but other than that, installation was easy!  The first time I tried, the holes weren't quite lined up, but I carefully peeled it back and tried again--perfect!  The included card easily removed the couple of air bubbles that formed.  It does show fingerprints, but I'd rather have that than a matte protector that dulls or pixelates the screen's vibrant colors (we had a different brand of anti-fingerprint for our iPad and completely hated it).  This protector shows the colors perfectly!
0.5208695	0.66997945	It is a good screen protectoer, but it is not a privacy screen as claimed by the vendor!  You can see everything from all angels (just a little dimmer). I've had privacy screens on my previoous phones and they were all great, but this one does not provide privacy!!!
0.59597456	0.5637471	First, bought the privacy screen protector for my white iphone 5. Then, I saw that it didn't look good on my phone, and there were a few problems (MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY ME!). SO, I CONTACTED THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT, ...AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS AMAZING!!!!!I guess the problem was in my decision to buy the wrong one, but Tech armor contacted me and resolved the issue............ BY SENDING OUT ONE....... sorry NINE!!!! FOR FREE.... AND THAT TOO BY 1st CLASS MAIL! In conclusion, anyone who wants good customer service along with an AMAZING PRODUCT should try Tech Armor. Tech Armor for life!
0.9964796	0.7958685999999999	Definitely worth a buy. no second thoughts :-) I strongly recommend this screen protector. Instructions and support are very helpful.go for this...
0.99710274	0.7425679000000001	Nicely packaged and straightforward directions.  I highly recommend this product.  Three screen protectors come included (i wish there were five)
0.6068899	0.3620599	Very nice and not too hard to install, but had to have my son do it for me.  Once on it is really good.
0.8173117	0.54758084	u need to go to a professional and but this on cause i had a hard time putting this on! but other then that it works great!
0.982604	0.72395086	I got this product quickly in the mail and it was super easy to instal. Just like any other screen protector.
0.5167622000000001	0.491691	This comes with three separate protectors which I liked. What I didn't like was that no matter what you did prior to applying the protector there were always air bubbles. It may have just been the way that I was applying it, I'm not entirely sure. The other thing that bothered me is that when I applied my case the corner of the protector came up and now there is a large air bubble in the lower right hand corner of my screen. If you know you're good at applying these things I would recommend it, but if you're like me and have trouble try to find someone else to do it for you!
0.8879678	0.7686845999999999	This is my second order of these screen protectors. They are life savers! Not only are they absolutely flawless, but they actually do protect your screen. My phone fell screen down on gravel and my screen was left unscathed! About to order some more.. :)
0.96202445	0.72475225	This is really protective. The only downside is I feel like I lost some of the vibrant color of the phone once I put it on.
0.9978676999999999	0.8027350000000001	SO easy to apply and air bubbles were so easy to remove! Love that it came with a card, cloth, AND dust remover tape. Awesome product.
0.6713468	0.49628243	They give you 3 sheets but I ruined all three in the process of trying to apply them to my phone. HOWEVER: They sent me a new pack as soon as I voiced my concern. Phenomenal costumer service. Would definitely buy again. Take your time putting them on though...
0.7108593000000001	0.5118174	Apple makes us pay dearly only because it bears the Apple logo.Luckily, we have choices when it comes to accessories.My family of three all have iPhone 5s,and we couldn't be happier.
0.97021544	0.6987388000000001	It is really easy to apply. It does not leave finger prints and feels good. I don't need to worry about the oily feeling on the glass screen no more.
0.663615	0.76355064	I normally don't write product reviews... but on this I will make an exception.  Because this product is great and you can tell the quality the minute you open the package.  The company cares so much about customer service that they encourage you to contact them directly by leaving instructions on how to contact them.  The instructions given were spot on.... and what I loved most about there product is the fact that the sreen film is cut about 1/32&#34; shorter all the way around, which makes it easy for a novice to be a little off on alignment, but the product still looks great on the phone.My family just upgraded their phones, and I applied all the three in the package on 3 new phones we got today.  This is the first time that I did not screw up not once... from other vendors, I normally buy three and I am lucky to get one done right without bubles or alignment issues....Buy tech Armor, you will not be disappointed... all my future purchases of screen protectors are going to be tech armor.
0.95063955	0.7674873000000001	The film is easily installed and does not diminish the quality of the retina display, which was important to me. The cut-outs for the camera lens and speaker are way bigger than necessary, but it's not a huge issue. Overall, I am pleased with this product, and the price was good.
0.6365001	0.6873898	I bought these as a replacement for previous screen protectors I had purchased from Tech Armor.  The previous ones were anti-glare/anti-fingerprinting with a matte finish, which I didn't realize at the time I purchased them and found that I didn't like (they tended to blur the screen a little bit and made reading words slightly more difficult), so I purchased these clear screen protectors because Tech Armor doesn't allow exchanges (at least with opened products).  Anyway, it turns out I missed an important step during the setup process of these clear screen protectors, as I was under the belief that the installation procedures would be the same as the previous screen protector I had used, which was not the case.  Thankfully Tech Armor screen protectors come in 3-packs, so after I had rendered one screen protector useless in an attempt to install it via my botched process, I installed the second one.  However, because I had missed one of the important steps, that second screen protector that is now on my iPhone has some bubbles on one side and in the upper right corner, which I find annoying after having spent so much time trying to install it and get rid of lint and air bubbles.  The screen protector that I installed on my wife's iPhone setup perfectly and looks great.  I'm only giving three stars because I've spent $14 on screen protectors and had such a tedious setup experience.  The product looks and works great when installed correctly, just pay close attention to the setup instructions.
0.0068960786	0.46989217	This thing is awful.  I just took it off.  There were way too many bubbles.  It just got to be a pain.  Stay away from this item.
0.98605067	0.77824724	Three in a pack is the exact number needed, in case you make mistakes on the first one and will be needing another one in future. The touch is really smooth, so is the HD transparency.
0.9746404000000001	0.8952742	If you are in the market for a solid screen cover pick this up! Make sure to follow the directions in putting it on as not to trap air or other particles of dust or whatever underneath. The screen still responds flawlessly, fits well to screen and cover, it was cut well for the screen of my iPhone, and is easily cleaned. This isnt like some other peel-off screen covers which can be either cheap feeling, or tough to run your finger across because it keeps dragging. This isnt a cell think cover and lets your finger glide across without any resistance, picking up your every movement.I will say putting on the screen cover can be a little tricky! I spent one cover trying to get it right, and the second went on perfectly. I would suggest getting under a range hood or something of the sort with the fan on to suck up floating particles when putting the screen on in an attempt to reduce things getting trapped under your screen!I would screen covers from this company again!
0.85638994	0.7338908000000001	Looks great and goes on easy. I'd suggest ignoring the instruction insert as it's generic. Go to their website for device-specific installation pointers.
0.92601943	0.74357724	I bought one similar for $25.00 at Best Buy... Definitely will be returning that one since this does exactly the same thing and it's more than half the price!
0.8869767	0.52186215	overall its a great screen protector and it maintains the hd quality. yet, it says its a 100% bubble free application. either i was doing something wrong in my application (which i followed the instructions) or its not true. i still have a few bubbles.
0.9905499	0.8341318000000001	It is so nice to be able to read my screen in the sunshine without a glare!! And! No fingerprints!! Amazing!I've only been using this particular screen protector for about a month.  So far it seems very durable and there are no snags or flaws.  I imagine having the case surrounding the edges of the screen protector helps keep it in better shape (no unpeeling or tearing of the edges), but I think most people have their iPhones in a case so this shoudln't be an issue.This is a great product and I highly recommend it!
0.13119549	0.46387849999999997	I purchased the 3-pack a few days ago and I decided to apply them onto my Iphone 5 today.  As I was applying it, air bubbles would form and was impossible to remove with the little card that was provided.  I tried the second time and same thing happened.  I again tried it a third time and it was even worse than the first two.  I wiped down the screen before applying the screen protector very thoroughly and was very careful in applying.  I've applied other brands such as MPERO and ZAGG screen protectors and never had a problem with applying them.  I bought these because of the reviews on here but I felt like I just wasted my money.
0.72400093	0.56513774	iPhone 5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector (3-Pack)Fairly straightforward install if you've done this sort of thing before. You can always look on youtube for tips on installing screen protectors.The screen feel is different from the iPhone glass itself but I wouldn't say it's something to worry about.
0.041228533	0.50177604	First things first, received on time and the product is as per the description. No surprises here.But i used up all the three that i received still could not get to install it properlyFirst attempt:Cleaned the surface with the cloth provided. Aligned the home button slot and continued with the rest. By the time i reached the other end slowly it was way off and the slots for speaker and front camera dint align. tried to remove and re paste it. it was about 3 or 4 times i tried. final result - many bubbles and dust particles. I threw this one as i felt the adhesive was not strong by this timeSecond attempt:Again cleaned the surface and was able to get the alignment not that bad after a few trials. This time i was cautious enough to clean the surface each time i removed to align it. Alignment was better but there was lot of lint. Pondered for sometime and realized that the cloth was not clean anymore. this is really testing my patience now. Threw this away and went on to the next oneThird attempt:Determined to fix it the very first attempt (really ?) with the third screen protector. Woo hoo .. got the alignment better even though if it is not perfect. As cleaned it with a tape there was not much lint expect near the corners. There were bubbles which i was able to remove with some effort. Now 2 of the right corners and the little space below the home button did not stick properly. I tried to lift a little from the edges and cleared of the dirt / lint from the area. Result - the corner is bent and show a seam on the surface.I will research little more online and order a new screen protector. I cannot have this more than a week on by phone. i will not recommend this to my cousin who will be getting iphone next month for birthday
0.012322633999999999	0.5529675000000001	Not worth the price! i tried to instal, too many bubbles made installation difficult. had to throw off two of three screens and the last one had series of bubbles :-(
0.99914956	0.8538554	This was the absolutely easiest to apply screen protector ever!!  I had no difficulty applying it even with repositioning once.  I could not recommend this product more highly.  Excellent!
0.8774037	0.7792865	Great, does not even seem like I have a cover on. No glare on the phone. Went on quite easily.
0.3136053	0.49754298	I had to take it off because it really effected the quality of the screen. I guess I like the clear ones better
0.7155012	0.6731514000000001	I wanted an affordable new screen protector for my iPhone, so I looked to Amazon.  There are many options, but I chose the brand that seemed to have the best reviews.  The Tech Armor was so simple to put on, I couldn't believe it. It literally took 10 seconds.  The apple screen protector I had took forever to get right, and I ruined one in the process.  Not the case with this brand. Also, there were no issues with bubbles or poor alignment.  The screen protector is inexpensive, but the quality seems great.  I like that it is both anti-glare and anti-fingerprint.  Some reviewers ordered screen protectors from Chinese manufacturers that took weeks to arrive, so I made sure to order from a company whose products were stocked at an Amazon warehouse.  My order arrived within days, and I am very happy.
0.972269	0.76414406	"Great clarity, seems like solid protection, and appreciate their promise of customer satisfaction. Was able to apply without getting any dust or bubbles underneath, which did take time and patience, but is reasonably possible - they have an amusingly formal guide online with ""pro-tips"" which seem practical.Two things to note: top of case does not have opening for light sensor (probably a non-issue as protector is clear), and the protector is not as smooth/frictionless as the original glass front (although after using it for a while I notice it less)I would recommend this product"
0.9928152	0.69173837	Absolutely fine product. The best screen Protector  I've used so far. I love it.Like: price, quality, durabilityDislike: ---Recommendation: Yes.
0.30245638	0.44614744	Hi,I ordered this item for my new iPhone 5 and ended up loosing all 3 screen protectors. The first 2 were horrible with too many bubbles and the third one was kind of ok with few bubbles.the screen protector is good if you don't have bubbles. Its smooth and has as natural feel but could not lay them without bubbles :(.Thanks,Santosh
0.9876375	0.84649837	No rocket science, its a good quality screen protector and very easy to apply also. Only thing i feel is the directions to apply can be made more intuitive and understandable. With 1 and 2  mentioned in so small font on the Remove me sticker and no specific caution is mentioned on which sticker to take out first , i think many people can find it confusing and may waste one of the screen film in their first try, i also end up wasting one ;-). But its of good quality, fits perfectly and easy to clean. Recommend it.
0.76088476	0.65582114	Easy to apply! Only 2 little bubbles and they worked themselves out in less than 24 hours. No scratches yet
0.9995396000000001	0.8910978	This brand works perfectly. You can't even tell there's even a screen protector on my phone. People who look at my phone can't even tell there's a screen protector on it! It feels really smooth. I highly recommend this product. By the way, I also purchased a Tech Armor HD screen protector for my iPad and I love that too!
0.9879626	0.7265588000000001	This cover is great! I love that it's matte and not shiny. A few friends have asked me where I purchased because of this. I would definetly reccomend!
0.9935678	0.8509296000000001	This screen cover is fantastic! There are no fingerprints or smudges and the matte finish keeps it from reflecting outside and indoors. I would recommend this product to anyone!
0.9340708000000001	0.78027165	when i first got this product i tried to put on the screen protectors and failed with the first two because of bubbles so then i tried the third one and it still had bubbles. I then emailed the company and they were great, they responded quickly and were a great help. They immediately mailed me three new screen protectors free of charge and now they work greatly! By far the best customer service i have gotten.
0.99795973	0.7654848000000001	Great screen protector, good value. Easy to apply with provided tools and instructions. Maintains touch sensitivity and clear like nothing is there. Will use again.
0.97809386	0.7204733	I liked this product because I was able to place it smoothly onto my new iPhone and got none of those pesky air bubbles. Good cost-benefit.
0.62629354	0.6786685	Have had the same screen protector on for probably about 6 months now - it is scratched and the corner is beginning to peel a little bit, but it has done great in the time I have used it, especially for its price!
0.33686566	0.6255714	When I tried to put on the firs one, I pulled off the protective layer and it caused the screen protector to rip slightly at the bottom. It was pry my own fault, but I then had to use a second one in which I got multiple air bubbles. The third one went on perfect except for the fact that I have an otterbox defender series, and when I use it, it pushes the edge of the screen protector up causing air bubbles to form. When I take the case of I can rub the bubbles out, but as soon as I put the case back on, the bubbles return. Its almost like the screen protector didn't adhere properly to the phone. It's annoying but I'll live with it. Otherwise so far it's done its job. It's crystal clear and you can't even tell you have a screen protector on. If you're better at putting screen protectors on, this is the best brand I've found.
0.9909363999999999	0.8232056000000001	This is a great phone case and for the price you can not beat it. A three pack with a lifetime warranty. Just bought the five and put a protector on the moment I got it. Love it with the no fingerprint and matte finish features.
0.9980171999999998	0.84454525	Very easy to install and has stayed on with a case no problem.  From using many different screen protectors when I worked in the cell phone business - this has to be by far the easiest to install.  Very happy with my purchase and have all my extra screen protectors to use when it's time to change it.
0.9896337	0.83663166	No complaints. Installed one screen and it fits perfectly so I have 2 extra to give to friends or backup. I've had it for about 3 weeks and even though I take my case off often there are no signs of the screen protector peeling off.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
0.99333805	0.8024361999999999	I have already had this Tech armor screen protector on my Samsung galaxy S3 and now i had tried it on my iPhone 5.. This screen protector was right fit for my phone and i was able to get this installed on my mobile in less than 2 minutes and was done without even a single bubble. I was proud i have done it as a professional. :)Thanks for the supporting tips and accessories to get this installed.
0.84556377	0.7580674	I initially had trouble aligning the screen protector just right according to the instructions (peel back two inches of protective layer and align with bottom edge and apply adhesive side) - it kept getting crooked and trapping dust.  But with trying a second protector I peeled all the backing off and aligned the piece all at once - so much better!  And now my phone is very well-protected and the protector is very clear and does not disrupt the use of my phone at all.Especially because these are so much cheaper than apple brand covers, this is well worth the money spent.
0.0066821575	0.48216440000000005	not worth. not able to find the second layer. tried with all 3 pieces. all fails. followed the same process described in TechArmor site but of no use. i was under impression that screen protector was exactly fit but later realised that it was not at all stickd in my iphone5. May be i was doing something wrong in installation process.. all 3 pieces fails.
0.9970001000000001	0.8041176999999999	The screen protector works very well. It fits perfectly to the Iphone5 screen. I recommend it to Iphone5 users strongly
0.95170784	0.763055	Very nice screen protectors.  The clarity is excellent.  It doesn't look or feel like anything is covering the screen.  After three weeks, I have a small scratch on mine - which could have been on the screen of my iPhone 5.  These are a no-brainer investment.
0.2717839	0.3069484	After applying, I lost my original iphone touch, please try amFilm. I order amFilm and then I find amFilm is better then This.
0.82954186	0.7943393	I've been trying to decide if I like this screen protector or not. On the good side, it went on very easily.  The instructions that came with it and on the website are very clear.  I had no problems putting it on with no dust particles getting trapped.  Also, it helps with reducing glare and being able to read your phone outside.  On the bad side, it does reduce the clarity of the screen.  It takes away from the beauty of the retina display.  I also had issues with air bubbles around the edges when I put the phone case on.Update 5/13/13:  Customer service gets 5 stars.  They sent me the clear HD type which I prefer to the matte.  The HD are so much clearer. Yes, you are back to having trouble seeing your screen in bright light, but I can live with that over the haziness of the matte protector.  After trying both, HD is my choice.
0.99640703	0.7074975	I really appreciated the instructions that were included. The screen is great. I would definitely buy this brand again and recommend it to friends and family
0.9144169	0.7547535	I purchased this screen protector because it had favorable reviews and the price was cheap (especially for 3 protectors). Installation was a breeze and the product looks great on my iPhone 5. No air bubbles to speak of. I did attempt to put one on a friend's iPhone and found that there was some residue on the inside of the protector. I couldn't get it out with the applicator card or my finger nail. Consequently, his device has a small air bubble under the screen. If this particular screen protector didn't have that issue I would give this product the full five stars. That being said, it does come with three in the package so if you have some issues with installation you can just try another screen protector. Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend this brand to a friend!
0.9899683000000001	0.8210905999999999	so satisfied with my purchase! the screen protectors were great quality and super easy to put on. i got it the first try without having any major problems with bubbles. there were probably about 2 or 3 small air bubbles but that was easily removed with the bubble remover card included. it was great that it came with instructions and a small bubble remover card as i had already mentioned. great price with all that included along with the 3 protectors. definitely will be buying more from tech armor!
0.29903534	0.5719451	The item in nice packaging and arrived in new condition. However, after applying the screen protector after only a couple of days of use (no rough use, just in pocket) the protector is COMPLETELY scratched and has many fine and coarse scratches on the surface.
0.9063195	0.8094834	This review is based on my first impression after the first day of use of the anti-glare version. I thought the quality of the screen protectors is great and I appreciate all the useful extras Tech Armor provides along with them such as the dust removing stickers and the card. I was intimidated by its 2 layer design instead of the traditional 3 layer design, but after applying the screen protector completely, the screen protectors were sticky enough to avoid bubbles even from the very tiny dust particles. After using their card to press against the minor bubbles, the screen protector erased the bubbles even though there are tiny dust particles still underneath it. So after 10 minutes, the screen protector was literally bubble free!Tech Armor did a good job with this product and I don't think I will be needing their generous lifetime warranty! However, if I still need to see if the film will get easily get scratched just by putting in and taking out my device from my pockets.Definitely worth the money because Tech Armor will compensate if necessary unlike many other brands out there!
0.98365676	0.82853913	I recently bought an Iphone 5 (my first smart phone). At the store they sold me a screen protector to keep my phone protected until I could find one I liked. I absolutely hated the one they sold me (and will be returning it). I read the reviews on this product and know from past experience putting these types of screen covers on can be tricky. The sticky side is like a strong magnet for dust so you really need to be careful where you install it. I also suggest installing it under a bright light. The first one I installed was the practice one to see how it behaved and how hard it would be to get the air bubbles out. By the second one, I changed where I was installing it and it went much easier. I still have a hard time getting all the air bubbles out but any that are left are hidden by the outer case I have. I am a tactile person and I must say I do love the feel of this screen protector. I love that no fingerprints are visible. The only issue I have at this point is it seems that there a a couple of smudges on the screen depending on what rubbed against it. I have to wipe these away. Make sure to use long, fluid wipes otherwise you can see your wiping pattern when the screen is not lit. When the screen is lit I don't see anything. I appreciate that there is a lifetime replacement warranty but hope I don't have to use it. I am glad to have another one left over so that if I do need to use it I will be able to get the replacement without leaving my phone unprotected.
0.9942039	0.8184984000000001	This screen protector was so easy to put on. Normally I have so many bubbles and issues, but this was so simple.Also they make the holes at the top a bit larger so lining it up it easier than with some of the other screen protectors. Saved so much time and only had to use 1 of the 3.So can save the others for future.
0.16558865	0.40673652	Never could get the bubbles out. I ended up wasting all three of the screens and had my son try a couple times and he was able to do his phone perfectly with a different product.
0.9536667	0.6714026999999999	It applied onto the iPhone with the greatest of ease.  There's three in a pack.  A lot cheaper than buying from a retail location.
0.9179200999999999	0.8259419	It is clear, does not change the quality of how the phone responds to the touch. As expected with clear protectors it needs cleaning often as it shows finger prints. Installation was a breeze!
0.9877181	0.8178183000000001	These fit my iPhone 5 perfectly. They stuck to the screen really well and getting the air bubbles out was a cinch. Great product.
0.012742341	0.31353635	I guess you get what you pay for with this product, I tried 3 times to get this to fit right with no bubbles and had zero success. I'm very picky and have never used a screen protector before because I feel they make the phone look tacky and this did nothing to change my view. I'm either going to go without or have a professional place do it for me. If you're not picky and just want something cheap to protect your screen, this might be for you.
0.9871175999999999	0.6965859000000001	I'm writing this review because I love this product. I ordered this screen protector for my wife's iPhone 5, I was skeptical at first because like other products when you apply the screen protector to the phone it would always leave bubbles which are hard to get rid of, but not with this product once applied there were some bubbles but it disappeared after awhile. I would recommend this to all my friends who own expensive phones and who want to take care of their product for a long time.
0.95960915	0.6643494000000001	Not only does it do the job but it was surprisingly easy to install myself just by following the enclosed directions. Brilliant!
0.95137715	0.71544755	This was the first time my wife and I had bought iPhone's for ourselves so we wanted to get the best covers we could for our phones. I will say it is a little tricky to get on if you are a perfectionist like me, so we had to use all three unfortunately and the last one wasn't quite the way we wanted it. Hopefully it holds up if we ever drop it, but so far so good in the first couple of hours!!
0.67342883	0.59867793	Product is as described. Got the screen protector on on the first try. I've got 2 left for back-up for future!
0.95808864	0.74445117	This was a pretty good product and it was very easy to use. No bubbles on the screen on my Iphone 5.
0.9943219000000001	0.76577216	I took another reviewer's advice and installed it on my stove with the fan going. It is so clear you can't even tell you have a screen protector on. I love it and will continue to use this brand.
0.39567053	0.57648706	It's very easy to apply, had no dust or bubbles and goes on very easily. I however dont like the look of it. The matte texture distorts my picture a lot, even makes for fine print difficult to read.  Maybe that's just how the matte protectors are and I didn't know any better but I would prefer something more clear.
0.99936545	0.8302425999999999	Tech Armor makes really great screen protector and we are always pleased. They are always our first choice in screen protection. We love the price and quality.
0.9736153000000001	0.6828183000000001	I like this product and have only used 1 protector thus far. I like the quality and have had no issues at all.
0.62598723	0.65124434	Not much to say about screen covers, but the price of these were very low and are very good quality!!!
0.87801653	0.75196576	I bought these not only because there are 3 in the pack but also because some of the reviews that stated no rainbow effect. The protector is easy to apply but take your time to line it up right and do it slowly, you won't have any air bubbles. I had also picked up the 3M just in case these were no good but to my surprise they are. I tried the 3M first thinking well, more expensive and the brand name would be best to start with but it was a disaster from the get go for various reasons including rainbow, lines that wouldn't rub out and no step instructions on the protector itself for what to peal first.3M Natural View NV827748 Screen Protector for iPhone 5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Clearalso you only get one for 12 bucks so its double the price for junk.I'm very happy with the Tech Armor ones and have no complaints other than it holds finger prints a bit more than expected but I keep the microfiber cloth in my pocket with the phone to wipe it down now and then.
0.97623515	0.7914825	I've used numerous screen protectors on my iPhone, iPad, etc.This one seemed to install easier and I only ended up with a couple of very minor pieces of dust under the protector ( my fault).Other than that, it is very clear and doesn't distort the retina display at all so I am very satisfied.
0.9202697	0.72086596	Got it because I drive a convertible and didn't want glare. Works great for that but the screen quality gets less crisp with it. A sacrifice I'm happy to make but an FYI.
0.98439825	0.78792095	These screen protectors are the best I have ever used. They are crystal clear and do not seem to require extra pressure like other screen protectors on the market. It truly is an invisible shield for your screen.
0.30769876	0.5506274999999999	If it gets a little scratch on it it will make your device non responsive. Surface is also uncomfortable and sticky.
0.9943296	0.78667486	Worked very well and easy to install without &#34;bubbles&#34;. I have tried numerous types and this was the best to date.
0.38314483	0.44299585	For my new iPhone 5 I decided to use a screen protector and decided to try this one by Tech Armor. I watched the video and followed the instructions. My first issue was the protector does not stick well to the iPhone. Second, installing is not as easy as the video intimates - getting all the bubbles out is impossible. And, lastly, after I removed as many bubbles as possible I was not happy with the 'touch and feel' of the protector versus the 'touch and feel' of the actual iPhone screen. Bottom line...I removed the screen protector.
0.92444193	0.7519821999999999	Goes on with no problem.Very clear ( never understood why some people get the matte finish for such a sharp display )Comes with a dust removing tape for installation. Big plus!Great customer service as well
0.99245036	0.82455456	inexspensive and good quality.  Doesn't leave much finger print.  Very easy to apply. It fits perfectly on the iphone 5.
0.08277461	0.33568978	To be fair, the following may have been a result of the USPS. First things first, my package went to my old address. When I got it , the package was bent which meant my screen protectors were bent. As a result they need not press on to my screen well. I used all three protectors to no avail. I will be calling amazon tomorrow about this, and I will be going to best buy or my sprint store to buy a better screen protector. Thanks for nothing
0.05297774	0.5049207	These are a pain to line up on your iPhone, and also got air bubbles and scratches on it even though it was already placed (took 3 times)
0.99905115	0.8932034	Easy installation and great price.  Definitely would recommend this product for anyone with an iPhone.  Zero bubbles and took about two minutes to put on.  Recommend watching the video for installation.
0.5608219	0.44776356	This is my first time to put a protector on my iPhone. I thought it may reduce the definition of screen, but I m wrong, it looks invisible! Thank you!
0.13360968	0.56370914	This screen protector works great and they send you three! for a reason. It is an absolute pain to install! It could be the fact that lining up the camera, sensor and earpiece is nearly impossible. The good side to this is that even if you get it wrong the protector does not impede the functionality.
0.9893702	0.7640026999999999	The screen protector is of good quality and thickness, and the application is easy. Worked perfect for my Otterbox Defender.
0.99306965	0.88390183	Does everything it says it does. It's a great product. Look no further than right here. It's easy to apply. And, there are videos on the website to assist you if you have any problems. I would definitely recommend this product. Also, the screen on the iPhone 5 actually looks brighter and more high-quality with the cover then without. I keep my iPhone in my pocket, and after a week there are still no scratches on the screen. It seems to be very durable.
0.29271725	0.48137727	Looks good - but awkward on white phone.Works as expected - wish I was warned about how &#34;Dark&#34; it is. I realize it's a privacy screen but it does not blend into white phones like it does black. Gives the appearance of a black screen.Threw a case with a black border on it, and now it looks fine. Would not recommend on a white phone without a case.
0.98913825	0.8634982	I've been using screen guards on my phone since the original iPhone, I've also helped people apply their guards.This screen protector is the absolute best screen protector I've ever applied and used.I have NEVER applied a screen guard without getting a bubble I couldn't remove or a piece of dust I couldn't remove. This screen protector went on flawlessly, I got a small piece of dust in it which I was bummed out about but then I read the instructions and it said it had a dust removing sticker. I took out the dust, reapplied and it was perfect. The holes on the screen for the home button and camera line up PERFECTLY.I can't say enough about this. I don't review products but I had to write something about this product. It was so good, applied so quickly and provides me with protection without even noticing there is a screen guard on there.
0.22157872	0.5956300999999999	This is an update to first review. I thought this case was too big but now I know that the iphone 5 costs $239 dollars to replace when you break the glass screen and there is no cheaper option... even aftermaket screen replacement cost more due to $189 parts cost (labor makes it more than $239 so they dont bother) from apple for the 5 screen according the kiosk vendor at the mall.I dropped mine from 3 feet with a slim case (not this one) and it shattered. You need to have the lip come around the screen face with a soft material like this case offers to keep it from shattering. Dont make the mistake I did and repplace it with a slim version.OLD REVIEWBigger than expected. This cover is good if you are looking for maximum protection and are willing to increase the size of your phone. It comes with a screen protector too. I carry it in my front pocket and the hard plastic outside makes this possible but the exposed inner silicone parts attract lint(black color). I saw the one my friend got from the Apple atore and it was slimmer and the screen cover was a matte finish which looks cleaner however it does not offer the impact protection I would guess. This screen protector that comes with this cover is more glossy and always looks like it needs to be cleaned from fingerprints. The cutouts for cameras on front do not match the ones on the screen protector from Apple but it works OK for the money. My next cover and screen protector will be from the Apple store although it was probably cost double the price.
0.9565066999999999	0.6639139000000001	I usually leave reviews to only AMAZING products i buy, well guess which one made me grab my laptop!First of all i thought the packaging i got it was excessively big, i guess its because i ordered some otterbox cases and then canceled them. AAAAAAANYWAYS, i loved the presentation. Very professional, and nicely presented compared to many others.Opened that bad boy up and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. Yeah you might say: BUT ALL ARE THE SAME! (INSERT DUMB FACE HERE), yes while that may be true. ALL ARE DIFFERENT. I actually enjoyed reading it and i started the operation.1ST: APPLY SCREEN PROTECTOR AS INSTRUCTED2ND: SMILE AND SAY: DAAAMN THATS A GREAT PROTECTOR.3RD: ENJOY YOUR MONEY WELL SPENTPersonal description of the product itself? AMAZING, NO FINGERPRINTS, NO BUBBLES(NOT EVEN ONE!),VERY RESISTANT, WELL MADE WITH GOOD MATERIAL, MY SCREEN IS VERY CLEAR COMPARED TO OTHERS IVE HAD.Just a nice friendly suggestion, make the squeegee card out of thin plastic. That squeegee card was almost useless to me, even thought i didnt even use it! and please.. a bigger wipe would be nicer as well, kind of as a gift ;)TNAKS YOU VERY MUCH TECH ARMOR! I AM A VERY SATISFIED COSTUMER!
0.97765875	0.85104364	This easily applied to my iPhone and is pretty much invisible. I always have had great success applying these by cleaning screen with rubbing alcohol first. Wipe any remaining dust off or blow off. Apply in a well lit area to be able to see any dust. Apply at bottom edge and slowly roll the protector onto phone. You shouldn't get a single bubble underneath!
0.9969734	0.8249099	Great item. Fits perfectly and comes with all the tools needed, including dust remover tape and the card to get bubbles out. Worth the price.
0.9862056	0.7263137	I successfully applied with the first try.The protector is really easy to apply and crystal clear.The best protecter for iPhone 5.
0.9967306999999999	0.8016797	The best screen protector ever. The instructions helped in a great deal that i never had a air bubble in my phone screen. The touch response is so perfect like using the phone without the screen protector.
0.08706409	0.53071576	I bought this product for my iPhone 5. I tried to put on the screen protector numerous times, but I always had bubbles or fingerprints, even though I followed the directions included.  After trying the first two protectors and discarding them, I tried the third one.  It still has fingerprints on it, but it was less noticeable than the first two tries. I'm disappointed in the product.
0.9382155000000001	0.70879924	I just bought this a couple of months ago. its really good in terms of price and quality & installation steps.
0.96076536	0.66497487	The product came with three clear screens. With the help from instructions in the package and some youtube videos, I was able to apply the first one successfully with no bubbles or dust. fantastic product.
0.9152921999999999	0.46808180000000005	It was great protecter for my iphone. I like it so much thank you. good luck for you guys. have a nice day
0.8720621	0.87254775	Pros:- The relation between quality over price is superb!  I don't think you can find anything better in this aspect out there.- IF YOU FOLLOW the installation instructions and WATCH THE VIDEOS on youtube, the installation is easy.- The Anti-Fingerprint surface makes your phone look clean every time.- The cuts for the bottom button, the speaker and the camera are well located.- The matte finish &#34;hides&#34; any scratches that the film might get during its useful life.  In other words, a scratch is much less obvious on a matte surface than on a shiny one.Cons:- The matte finish of the screen protector takes out a considerable amount of sharpness of your retina display (things look a little blurry).- The matte finish makes your phone's screen less bright.  You may find yourself boosting the phone's brightness to be able to see through the screen.  Of course, more brightness equals less battery life.- Although the anti-glare function works very well, the screen is very difficult to see if you are under direct sunlight because of the brightness issue I mentioned before (even if you boost the brightness to the max).  If you are planning to use your phone a lot under sunlight try something else.- The &#34;lint-free&#34; cloth that is included is not lint-free.  I had to use an optical cleaning paper to remove the lint of my phone before installing the film.- I've used mine for one week and it already has a minor scratch on it. (I take care of my phone and I have it protected with a case)The bottom line:It is very good product if you accept or don't mind about the issues I mentioned in the cons.  If you do care about the loss of sharpness and/or brightness (as I do), give the HD version a try and please let me know how it works.
0.8141607	0.7094261	This screen protector is alright. It took me awhile to get it on and smooth out the bubbles and I still have a few, but I can live with it. It does not scroll perfectly, I find it catches my finger every couple scrolls. So it's not totally smooth for that but yet again I can live with it. I've had Zagg protectors which I think are the best but they are expensive so that's why I opted for this one. I would perfer a Zagg but for now and cost wise, this will do for now.
0.9913405000000001	0.8447519	Tech Armor protected my iPhone 4 beautifully for 3 years, so I knew it would be the right choice for my new iPhone 5. Good screen protectors are never a snap to apply, but this one is at least not as difficult as some. It took me a couple of tries to get the film positioned exactly on the screen, but the cutouts are perfect and I was able to get a completely no-bubbles installation, which was a relief. Once applied, you can't even tell that it's there, screen quality is not reduced in any way. There's also an installation video on their website which, if nothing else, builds confidence in butterfingers like myself. Love that it comes in a 3-pack, too!
0.014866501	0.36957002	Three pieces of crap. Worst screen protector I've ever purchased. The thousands of five star ratings is a big hoax.
0.7653495	0.62061477	I'm very happy with my choice on this...normally, I'm not a big screen protector guy, but I am very happy with this one.  I have a couple air bubbles I can get out, but they are near the corners, and do not impact my use at all (and they are probably due to user error in application, more than anything else).
0.9920819	0.81141514	It does exactly as described. I have had this for 5 months on my iphone 5 and sometimes i even think its not on there until i cross check again. it does not interfere with the phone's brightness nor the touch ability like most of them does and am glad I purchased this one. I have not had any issue with it. iphone 5--- BUY THIS.Note* Take your time, follow the instructions and get it right when applying it. You will be happy
0.9877101	0.80795056	It came in the mail pretty early and instal was super easy. I've had other screen savers where it too 20 min to install it perfectly and you Would still get dust stuck underneath the screen. This took me 5 min and it was a perfect fit. Can't ask for a better screen protector. I'm still kind of iffy about the lifetime warranty.
0.97360593	0.8605130999999999	Tried the Tech Armor HD Clear and the anti-glare. The clear is great; the anti-glare version interferes with the sharp display of the iPhone 5 and has a weird, papery feel that I disliked. But both went on more easily than the several other brands I tried, which I simply could not put on without bubbles created by microscopic motes of dust that adhered to the sticky side of the non-Tech-Armor screen protectors. I used several techniques with the Tech Armor: applied it in a humid bathroom to tamp down dust (and turned the fan off on the home heating system); had scotch tape ready to lift a corner of the protector (thus avoiding touching it with my fingers) and another piece of tape ready to tap the glass screen and also the sticky side of the screen saver wherever dust appeared in the process of application; and peeled the back of the screen saver off gradually as it was being laid down on the phone. It worked! Perfect adhesion, no bubbles, great clarity.
0.9915978000000001	0.84374624	Bought 2 packs of these because I am accustomed to getting alot of bubbles a having the need to do it over, but this is the first screen protector that has ever worked so perfectly for me, I have had sooo many mobile devices in my past and I put screen protector on all. Within my household I have 3 iPads, 5 iPhones and 2 Galaxy SIIs and I used various brands of protectors on all but this is the first time I have had such little problems installing one. The cut was perfect, the protector is totally clear and allows for the full potential of the retina display and I only got 2 very small bubbles on installation which was easily fixed by using the card to scrape the bubbles out. It is now almost impossible to see the protector on the phone, and I have 5 extras to spare.. :)
0.3684323	0.5936508	The protector adhered nicely and privacy diffuser works very nicely.  Priced well.  I think the profile of the cuts is a little less than precise, about a 1/16&#34; dia. smaller than the home button, however it has not caused me any problems.  Unfortunately my case is causing one of the corners to turn up because protector meets the case at the same place.  Not putting any blame on the screen protector, but beware that it may not work flawlessly with an outer case.
0.99752355	0.74390817	Great screen protector for iphone5.  Fits well. Was easy to install. Good clarity. Cheaper than what is available at ATT stores.
0.9903799000000001	0.81877875	The screen protector, protects the screen from all of the times I've dropped my phone. The Matte gives it a good feeling on my finger. Overall a great product.
0.9721548000000001	0.65338445	This is just as good as the one you get from the apple store - but fraction of the price! Very pleased!
0.9815438	0.7570100000000001	Not only Tech Armor have a great product, they also have great customer service! When I first got mine, I read the instruction wrong and kinda destroyed my screen protector. I emailed the customer service and they reply right away and sent me the replacement withing a few days. Not only that, Tech Armor have LIFETIME Warranty!!! I recommend Tech Armor to all my friends and they all love it!
0.95027614	0.7386996	Does it's job of protecting my husband's new iphone screen. Not the easiest to install, but no complaints at this time. Excellent customer service! Was sent 2 protectors instead of 3 (in a pack of 3) and they sent me a replacement and was very kind in the process.
0.9249221	0.78812456	This is a no bull, high quality screen protector. It applies very well and dust, lint, and bubbles hardly get under the screen protector if you know how to apply it properly. Once you apply it, you hardly notice in everyday use. If there is smudge or finger prints on the screen, just wipe it a cloth and it will look like there is nothing on your iPhone's screen. Crystal clear and wonderful.
0.86730146	0.6569421999999999	Good quality overall. It feels good and no issues, no rip or tear. You got to have a screen protection.
0.06919113	0.58635235	cannot give less than 1 star!! you get three for whatever price, but they kept coming off my phone. don't buy this!
0.99028945	0.85007596	screen protector goes on very easily, no bubbles, etc & I love the matte finish- no smears, glare or fingerprints!
0.36266187	0.5322469	Tried putting them on and had a lot of bubbles appear, simply flipped it around after realizing i must have been trying to apply the wrong side, went on very smoothly from there didn't have to smooth out any bubbles except for a small one in the corner which I've never been able to not get when applying one of these.
0.936975	0.6927551	I haven't used them, but I they are look like with high quality. And they deserves the price. They worth it. They are clear, but one thing to recommend, this kind of material will still leave some fingerprints. We'd better have to clean the screen in case that it seems not clear enough.
0.9974179	0.8402933000000001	Unlike cheap brand screen protectors, these ones DO NOT peel after long-term use.  They fit perfectly and are priced great, highly recommended.
0.42666328	0.60783815	I have always had a hard time putting screen covers on my iPhone, and usually have had to waste at least one to get it right.  These covers went on smoothly and I only had a few bubbles to work out.
0.77790153	0.79169834	These fit well and are easy to apply. The only thing I don't like is that it picks up fingerprints and grease readily and I'm constantly wiping it down. It also gets scratches relatively easily, but considering the price for three, I can just replace them.
0.9864013	0.7768049	I love the matted texture.  It was easy to install and user friendly. After the first install, I realized it was on crooked, so I peeled it off and reapplied -- it went on just as beautifully the second time!
0.39592054	0.4112012	Keep in mind that I have never owned an iPhone before so this is my first experience and I have nothing to compare it to. I did this while watching the video they have on the site, and it was pain-free! I do have one mini-bubble at the very edge that I could not get out, but I can live with it. I didn't want to use up another one and risk having it be worse. Usability wise - it's getting a little smudgy, but I guess since it's not the anti-fingerprint variety, I can't complain. Overall, very happy!
0.9815128000000001	0.74336624	I got my privacy screen I just took I it out of the package and stuck it on the front it works great I love it!
0.9982715	0.82170975	Great Product. Easy to put on. Dummie-proof instructions. Seriously so simple. No air bubbles, at all. Fits entire phone. Would definitely buy another product from this seller. I am very happy with this purchase.
0.85177743	0.76549053	These seemed easier to apply than the previous ones we used on earlier iPhones. More importantly, they don't change the screen quality at all, whereas every screen protector before slightly diminished image appearance. Because of that, we went too long without protection, but now we wish we'd done this sooner.
0.27268958	0.39478093	it way better then any other screen protector out there now, & anti-glare it good & anti-fingerprint it okay but not dat great
0.8294469000000001	0.7279937	very nice screen protector! it does its job and if your a fan of that kind of matte look on your iphone screen, this'll do the job. it feels as well as looks like a matte screen protector. anti glare is great. being that it is matte, it'll very slightly dim your iphone screen, so that means you may have to increase brightness just slightly to adjust to it. but that in my book isnt a negative, its just common sense that if you like the look and feel of a matte screen protector you have to adjust to it with brightness.
0.6363918000000001	0.51992047	Hi yes I just received my privacy screen I followed all the steps it fit on perfect yada yada lol, but it's not doing what I brought it for and that was for privacy you can still see what I'm typing you still see what I'm doing it just made my screen a little Darker. Is there any screen protector that really provides privacy out there somebody please let me know.
0.9694976999999999	0.7450420999999999	Tech armor stood by there promise and replaced my damaged screen protector. I am very happy with the product, I use my phone for most hours of my day, and I got a small pealing from the last screen protector, and it bugged me very much, emailed tech armor and the immediately sent out a brand new one.
0.014265895	0.44419122	Wouldn't go on right. No matter how many times I tried couldn't get the bubbles off the screen. I would reccomend just getting a case
0.97729325	0.7223085	This is a good value to protect your iPhone screen.  The product met my expectations and I would expect or get more when I am done with this one.
0.028481722	0.38193598	"I have no idea if what I received is even ""Tech Armor"".  No package, no instructions, label, just clear phone covers that could be any brand.  It actually got thrown in the garbage because it was so irrelevant/useless looking.  I had to go dig through the garbage when I realized it was missing from my order.  I've ordered Tech Armor in the past and have been VERY happy with it.  Joy Electronics is the one to blame for this.....Not Tech Armor.  But I've had ZERO response from Joy Electronics."
0.9852665999999999	0.79789484	The holes match up nicely.  It's very smooth.  It feels like there is nothing on it all.  Great value for the money.
0.98617125	0.82891905	These are the best screen protectors I've ever used! No bubbles & went on great. I didn't line it up perfectly at first so I took it off & put it on again & no bubbles. Any bubbles that were there left when I used the squeegee. My mom accidentally bought the iPad mini size for her iPad & gave them to me. My iPad mini screen is now bubble free!!!!!
0.9467308000000001	0.68025875	This item is easy to put on the iphone.  It protects the screen and it doesn't even look like there is a screen protector. I really appreciate that there is a lifetime replacement warranty.
0.61746246	0.46291643	I guess we will have to see how long it lasts.  It was quite a good product for the price.
0.66734695	0.623638	I have used other WAY MORE EXPENSIVE screen protectors when I bought my iphone 5, I was not very satisfied with the quality for the price with the others. I had a iphone 4s and used a similar protector but didnt hold up as long as i had hoped but then again it wasnt that expensive either. This time I opted to try the Tech Armor screen protector and I have to say I made a great choice, it was inexpensive but not on the quality part. Tech Armor even contacted me to see if i was satisfied with the product, I didnt respond because at the time of purchasing these protectors i had already dropped $30 bucks on a protector just so that I would have my screen protected as soon as I bought it. That protector that was $30 even started to bulge up on the ends and didnt last too long.  These screen protectors from Tech Armor seem to be much better, they are cheap ($7 for a 3-pack) compared to $30 for one!!), but have good workmanship and seem to be worth every penny.If your looking to protect your iphone 5 from scratches then this is a no brainier, buy this screen protector from Tech Armor, you wont be disappointed!!!Given a 4-star rating only because I have only had this protector on my iphone for a short time now, but so far seems to be holding up very well
0.41320765	0.47863927	I installed it to my phone on my first try without any bubbles and I am not really good on this kind of stuffGood product.
0.9991777000000001	0.8903805	I love people. I also love privacy when I am around people.. This product gives me the privacy I so desire in a life where people get to watch EVERY THING you do on your phone!!!!!! yikes! no thank you!  Yes I want to check FB at an inappropriate time, and NO it's none of your biz!!!The screen is great, as in I don't notice any response/ delay issues with the touch screen. I've seen other people use screen protectors where it interfered with their screen response.  Next phone I'm getting a black one, as I can't imagine having a phone without a privacy screen... and the white does look a bit odd peaking though the 2 spots.. (which is clearly necessary!!)  but small price to pay for the privacy...  thank you Armor Tech for your above and beyond customer service and making a superior product! very pleased!!!!!!ALSO another HUGE benefit is of course it keeps my screen protected... I noticed there are some hairline scratches on the phone glass... glad to have not only the privacy, but preserving the value of my phone by keeping it from scrapes. huge fan and I clearly highly recommend this superior product!!!!!!! Go TECH AMOR!!!
0.4435423	0.74722856	It does give some form of privacy but you can still see the image on the screen, you just can't read the writing that easily.  I had a previous privacy screen that I got from AT&T store years ago with my old phone that when you stood on the side and looked it was completely dark.  If you are not used to privacy screens, it does take some getting used to.  Over all, I like it :)
0.9150481	0.91496015	The HD clear screen cover provides a very clear protective cover for your iPhone glass screen that is barely visible once applied.  It does not seem to diminish the touch sensitivity of the screen.  It is not difficult to apply if you take your time and do it in a clean, dust free area.  I would recommend that you watch the demonstration video on Tech Armor's website before you attempt to apply the screen cover, wash your hands thoroughly and wear disposable, powderfree gloves (ie latex or nonlatex).  Clean your iPhone screen thoroughly with eyeglass cleaner solution and clean microfiber cloth provided.  Approximate the alignment of the screen cover before you peel off the first protective plastic cover layer - I would suggest starting on the bottom edge/corner of the screen so you can center the round home button opening.  Peel off about 1/4 of the first protective plastic cover layer and apply the exposed adhesive surface of the HD clear screen cover to your clean iPhone glass screen. In a slow smooth motion, continue to peel off the first protective plastic cover layer while smoothing the HD clear screen cover onto your iPhone screen- this should minimize bubble formation. If the alignment is not correct, peel back part of the HD clear screen cover to allow realignment - do this before you completely apply the HD clear screen cover.  Once you are satisfied with the HD clear screen cover alignment, then peel off the second protective plastic cover layer.
0.99220383	0.69786555	My package arrived on time, before the expected delivery date in great condition. The screen protector as well as privacy protector works great for security and comfort.
0.9291976000000001	0.69953674	I always seem to get a speck of dust or a dog hair or something under the film when installing one of these things but that's my fault.  The product does exactly as it's listed it would.  It's a great price here on Amazon too.
0.9633586	0.6657850000000001	Received item in good time to take to my cell carrier and had them put on w/out one single bubble or problem! So clear, I do not know it's on, great!  HAVE A QUESTION........Could someone tell me: WHAT'S THE BEST WAY YOU'VE FOUND TO CLEAN/WIPE FINGERPRINTS OFF????  TIA
0.9981214	0.73790264	Quick shipping and quality product would order from this seller again. Using Amazon is easy and great pricing. Love the free shipping when you purchase minimum amount.
0.6030561	0.69249547	This is about my third screen protector purchase, and the other ones I ordered either were hard to apply without bubbling (impossible actually), changed how my screen looked, didn't fit, or just didn't protect it. This fits the 5 great, went on with zero bubbles my first time, doesn't detract from the great display of the new iphone, and feels protective. The upper mic and self-facing camera holes are a little big, but it's really unlikely up there will get scratched unless your phone is an acrobat. I love it!
0.9930008	0.81600153	I have used Zagg for all my other iphones and these were every bit as good!  Love the sticky paper that comes with for getting those rude little lint bits that always mess up a good install.  Nice anti-glare and shows no finger prints.  Love it!
0.9212376	0.6868991999999999	This product and packaging was well thought out and had all the tools and instructions for applying easily and with NO bubbles!!  Well done!  I was nervous it would be a disaster...but, no fear, followed the instructions, used the enclosed tools and voila!!Great price, too!!
0.7802477	0.61262524	I only had this screen protector for three days and so far so good. My screen just a bit cloudier with the protector on. Not very a big deal but I wish it didn't have that effect.
0.9896045	0.7915199	I was in a rush and pretty much slapped this on to my phone screen.  It still looks great - very hard to tell there is a screen protector at all.  Great product!
0.9599529	0.6911863	This thing is awesome. I can use my iphone on the sun and the glare wouldn't mess with my iphone screen.
0.6628069999999999	0.50668406	Withholding the last star for a little more time with the product.  One thing that struck me funny: If it has a lifetime warranty, why does it come in a 3-pack?
0.35415399999999997	0.5639685000000001	Despite reading the instructions, it was confusing to figure out how to apply the film over my iphone. So after messing up the first one and having to throw it away, I watched a Youtube video demonstrating the proper way to apply it (crazy how there's a video out there for everything these day). Even after watching that, I still ended up with a big bubble  on the right side and didn't want to risk taking it off and starting over and potentially having to toss that one too, so I've bee bearing the bubble and aside from that spot, the rest looks great and feel good that it's protecting my screen. I'm sure that with the most steady of hand, it looks invisible, though I found this difficult to achieve.
0.62367815	0.8418985000000001	....experience on first purchase. Reduced glare....check! Scratch resistant ....check! Not glossy nor shiny....check! Easy to wipe off makeup residue ....check! Durable....check!
0.5974189999999999	0.5801599000000001	I put all 3 on and still don't have a good fit. It seems like they are just a little too big. I've used different brands on my other phones and didn't run into this problem. Maybe the sleekness of the iphone 5 is messing me and my big fingers up. ;-) I'm going to have to get more.
0.9433315999999999	0.7384848	It was absolutely as described. The case fit perfectly. very good protection and very slim and comfortable but sturdy. The case white can get dirty very quickly but surely protection is the same.
0.98332477	0.78822833	Really not much to say other than these are three screen savers for the price that even discounters like Ross Stores charge for one. As such they can't be beat.Change them often and protect that wonderful IPhone screen surface.
0.98089194	0.746371	Truly antiglare, and easy to apply.  Also happy that I have 2 extra ones should anything happen to this one.  I seem to have a tendency to cut these things up.
0.10152581	0.4971894	The screen protector itself is of good quality and easy to install properly, but it leaves gaps exposed on the sides. I contacted the seller and they said it was just how they were supposed to be, but I want my whole screen to be protected. They were very nice and provided an entire refund and let me keep the covers. So I guess I will use them until I find something better.
0.9764789	0.83474934	Went on so easily, no bubbling whatsoever. It's a true matte, which is great for cutting down on glare and fingerprints. Going with the matte does affect the visibility of the screen resolution, but this is true with all matte protectors.
0.9745034	0.8166528000000001	The Tech Armor film is as easy to apply as they claim.  It went on with no bubbles, no hassles, and is completely clear and invisible.  Nice!
0.98765683	0.79634976	This screen protector is great. Easy 5 stars. It's easy to install, the picture is clear and reflection is minimal.
0.97667205	0.78088814	the anti glare/finger print does the job I have no complaints with this the product arrived on time and it was exactly what was ordered
0.8865736999999999	0.79481393	I would give this screen protector five stars but I have some issues with it. First of all, for $8 I could have purchased a 4 pack of screen protectors. Paying $8 for one is ridiculous. Second of all, the screen protector went on great but I got something stuck on my screen beforehand and now it's stuck there. It looks like a little hair. I wiped the screen down with the cloth they provided several times beforehand and it didn't seem to catch this darn hair on my screen. If the package came with more screen protectors I would've put on another one. But I plan to leave it on and get my $8 worth. Also, there were two very small bubbles on the screen. Hardly noticeable though so it doesn't bother me much. It makes my screen look a tad bit grainy. Also, if you're using this for privacy, word of advice: turn the brightness down. If you put the brightness all the way up you can see what's going on from any angle. Besides all the negatives, this screen protector stays on very well and it's protecting my screen beautifully
0.9780296	0.7908224	For the very first time since owning a variety of mobile devices, I was able to easily put this screen protector on my iPhone 5 without getting bubbles or dust under it.  Usually, I waste the first one or two screen protectors due to difficult installation but the Tech Armor was a breeze to install and there are two others in the package as back-up.  Highly recommended.
0.9944905999999999	0.7951054	The packaging, the product, and my phone touchscreen performance after switching to the TechArmor were flawless. I really haven't seen a such complete product in a very long time. I can hardly notice that my phone has a screen protector on.Definitely my all-time best purchase on Amazon.
0.9918555	0.7367055	One of the best screen protectors and I highly recommend this. Applying some of the wet spray screen protectors are very difficult to apply, but this one solves the issue with no spray and an excellent self sticking product. Though it takes a long time and a lot of patience to apply
0.98316514	0.82129496	These are some of the best screen protectors I've ever seen.  In fact if someone put one of these on your phone without telling you, it would probably take quite a while before you realized it was even there.My only complaint would be that the edges of the protector around the home button feel slightly sharp, but that is more of an issue with screen protectors in general than with this particular brand.Highly recommended at this price, especially considering the fantastic customer service that other buyers are reporting.
0.9773764000000001	0.8134585	Here is my experience with this product:- I bought one pack (with 3 protector) but arrived 2 packs (6 protectors)- i read many tips on how to install correctly in order to avoid any dust or particles- i used tried to apply the protector below my celling fan (which did not work properly)- I've made 3 tries without success and achieved a perfect instalment on the 4th try...- all and all, i had to throw 3 protectors away, and now left with just one as spare..- the screen protector is of the highest quality and is almost invisible after the correct application.- FOR SURE WITH A BIT PRACTICE YOU CAN INSTALL IT PERFECT ON THE FIRST TIME!!Thank you for reading.
0.99310476	0.7248603	It arrived fast and it does the job! Product as described and I am very happy with it! Need screen protector? This is what u want! Has a matte look to it, many compliments!
0.9944632	0.6514597	I think by far the best screen protector I have used.Excellent qualityVery simple to installProtects from scratches and dustGreat PriceOverall I am very happy with the product and would recommend to everyone who has iPhone 5.
0.007862419	0.3347323	Despite of following the instructions correctly the screen protector comes off from the corners. Unlike the other reviews, the item which I received isn't of good quality at all. Also the matt finish defeats the purpose of iPhone's HD retina display. So instead of using up the other 2, I am returning them back to Amazon. Will buy a clear screen protector instead. Not sure if it will be Tech Armor.
0.98035	0.81699574	"This is the best screen protector I have for my iphone 5. Its perfect matte finish and anti-fingerprint qualities are simply superb. I had bought a thin case for my iphone and it came with a crystal clear screen protector - I was thoroughly disappointed with that screen protector - they did not give a squeegee and it became really difficult to remove all the air bubbles, and the shine and finger-print marks added to the woes. So I went in for this Tech Armor screen protector(1+2 is a bonus) and I swear I do not regret at all. If you have any second thoughts just keep them away and go for this great product.It surely has a ""Wow"" effect."
0.48627862	0.57935834	There is no privacy to be had with this product.  It slightly dims the screen at an angle not blocks it out. I know it's possible to black it out like I want because I bought a cheaper one for my wife's iPhone and it worked better than advertised.  Great screen protector, but doesn't do what I need.  Definitely creates a screen door look to the screen, so the loss of screen resolution isn't worth it.  Will be buying a different brand.  First and only 1 star review I've ever given.
0.96540964	0.8133637	For the price, this is absolutely great. I can see my phone when I'm out by the pool!It took a little bit, but I figured out how to remove bubbles without using support from the web. The process is a little tedious, but well worth it!Each screen protector probably only lasts a couple months (at the most) because I can already see tiny scratches and I've only had it a couple weeks, it is fairly cheep to replace, so no big deal.I definitely would recommend this over the ZAGG anti-glare.
0.026510328	0.50667185	Installed this spent about 1 and 1/2 and wasted all three (3) screen protecters that were included now my screen protecter has bubbles and smudges/dirt. Would not buy again.
0.9972011999999999	0.82014453	I love this screen protector...it is crystal clear and very easy to install...comes in a 3-pack so even if you were to mess one up during install you have two others and you really can't beat the price!
0.5704621	0.58758557	The screen protector is extremely clear almost like you don't have a screen protector. They also provide 3 which is helpful if your mess up applying the screen protector. You can't go wrong buying at this price.
0.9445964	0.79218745	I love this screen protector. Unlike my previous screen protector, it stayed on very well; it's already been several months! Even after being abused by my baby (teething, dropping, and fingerprints) and being in my cluttered purse, it only had a few apparent scratches. Honestly, one protector can go a long way!
0.88596857	0.6669014	Overall, I am pleased with the results. Application took a few tries and some patience to get it lined up but once that is done, the clearness of the film does not take away from the Retina HD display.
0.9973924000000001	0.8219837	This product went on easy and it also is crystal clear. I still have 2 more to use. Great product and totally recommended.
0.03692335	0.50936306	Not what I expected this is not a clear cover I did not like that is was hard & thick made the phone look dirty  & hard to see .
0.7671026999999999	0.7316712	This is a very good protective film that is truly faithful to the HD of the screen, so your picture quality won't be compromised.  However, like most films of this sort, it is challenging to put on so it is properly aligned with the button and the earphone and camera holes and so that you don't end up with bubbles.  The tools provided are helpful, especially the dust removing tape.  I found that using the tape is indispensable. If you have fat fingers or are in any way motor-skills challenged with your hands, forget it.  It's a good thing they give you 3 films in each pack because invariably you will mess up your first try and will have to toss that first film.  But once you do get it on right, it's great.
0.70334125	0.58120704	I had ordered the Incipio case for my iPhone 5 and it came with a free (temporary) screen protector. Not knowing this, I had purchased these screen protectors. Since it was not worth returning the protector, I wanted to give it a try. Though many stores employees said the screen protectors are cheap and temporary, I just love them. I am usually gently with my phone, and the free screen protector does its job so far.
0.34697032	0.4143388	The circles for the home button and camera don't line up perfectly. When you line up the home button circle, then the camera button circle doesn't line up. And I don't like the feel of the screen protector. It's really grainy feeling and not smooth. I won't be buying this again.
0.40635659999999996	0.5561577	This screen protector makes your phone screen look fantastic. I had a small bit of trouble getting it on straight enough for my liking, but it really wasn't difficult at all. After all, you have at least three attempts with this package.
0.9897720999999999	0.78293365	This product functions well and screen responds to touch without a problem; kit comes with cleaning cloth and tape for preparing screen for installation.
0.9973929	0.75431514	Easy to install, looks great and fits perfectly.  Happy with this brand and will definitely purchase again...but not for awhile cause I'm sure the ones I bought will last :)
0.5966134	0.8251755	
0.07216391	0.42180717	These did stick to my screen. I tried all three in the package and not one would stay on my phone screen and yes, I was using them correctly. Better to just buy them in the Apple store where they will put them on for you.
0.9977228000000001	0.9191778	I've used many different brands and types of screen protectors before but this is by far the best I've come across. I have never had great success in installing these clear protectors without some tiny bubble or dust particle caught underneath so I ordered two (3) packs to be safe. The contents of this kit are similar to every other with the actual protector, double protective peel off tabs and a wiping cloth but the thing that made the huge difference was the addition of a dust removal tape you use prior to application to ensure no dust gets trapped.Installation was easy, use the included cloth to wipe the screen, then remove any dust particles with the included tape sheet....I also used an LED flashlight held at an angle to identify any dust and surprisingly, dust would appear within seconds of using the tape to remove them...suggest doing this in a dust or wind free environment. This was not a big deal though as I simply used the included tape every time I saw a dust particle using the light and only applied the protector once no dust could be seen.The protectors cutouts are perfectly aligned but you must follow the numbers on the peel away layers to ensure the protector goes on the right side down (the cutouts for the camera and ear speaker hole are offset as there are sensors to the left of these) so you must follow the numbers on the peel away tabs to ensure proper application.Overall went on very easily and I finished two phones in about 10 minutes.Great product.
0.9093878000000001	0.7895701999999999	This screen protector was really easy to install. One of the nice things about it is the non-sticky coating on protector when installed. I've used Zagg protectors in the past and i greatly prefer the feel of this protector. It doesn't reduce screen quality and the touch screen is just as responsive as if there were no protector installed at all.
0.99561787	0.7397604999999999	This product is really good and nice looking. I recommend buying this product without any hesitation. Good value to the money you spent. .
0.99610186	0.7560958999999999	Excellent quality when fixed on the iPhone 5, really it is HD as stated. I love to use this product.
0.37153757	0.6884597	I was using expensive high end mat finishing anti finger print one. I compared with my wife's phone and I could see the anti finger print shield is affecting the display. So I bought this and now the display is crystal clear. It is worth for the money. Absolutely zero bubbles.
0.61038035	0.6293113	Seems like a great product so far. Although it did take me until the third try to get the screen protector on correctly, wasting the first two. If you can do it correctly on the first try it is definitely worth it.
0.7671253	0.49495628	"Let me tell you about my story...I had been given an iphone 5 as a birthday gift along with a so called good skin ""Skinomi""....Guess what?...It nearly ruined my phone...it is a wet screen applicator that may cause damage to your phone...it caused me hell lot of tensions....and the screen looked like sht.i was looking for the best screen protector...thn i found tech armor....Its crystal clear transparent and easy to install....But what if you made a mistake while applying it?...Dont you worry ......you will get like 3 extra skins to practice before making the perfect apply...I have tried other products like skinomi but they simply suck...they are wet screen applicators and they ruin your iphone....this is the best one i have found so far....GO FOR IT...DONT BUY SKINOMI OR OTHER WET APPLICATORS!!!!Unless u wanna ruin your phone!"
0.99456155	0.8298979999999999	$7.00 for 3 protectors.  These are great and as long as you can properly place it on the screen without any dust, you wouldn't even know these are there.  I love that they give you 3 in case you screw up the first time like I did.  I even had one left over and was able to put it on my wife's phone.  Great product!
0.99966705	0.8898444	Love it love it!!!!  I usually hate anti-glare screen protectors.These protectors are amazing.  I actually had to turn my brightness down on my iPhone 5.  The protector still changes it for the original clearness but not like other anti-glare.  If you want quality protector that provides no finger prints you have to have anti-glare.  These protectors are the way to go.The protector is a perfect fit feels good to the touch, minimizes finger prints, reduces glare, and at a Great Price.  I highly recommended.
0.40625963	0.5739618000000001	It doesn't go on well, it takes the screen clarity way down, but it does give some privacy, though not as much as advertised.
0.60079503	0.46199703	Bought the screen protector to go along with the TA frosted case and couldn't be happier. I had never put on a screen protector before, but since Verizon refused to put it on for me, I decided to give it a go (plus there are 3 of them so if you screw one up, you have other chances). I'm proud to say I got it done, without a single bubble or blemish, on the first try. I'm not sure if it was because it was a TE screen protector specifically, but I definitely think that had something to do with it. Awesome product!
0.9904290000000001	0.81659096	I recently dropped my new iphone 5 and decided to by a quality screen cover until I replace it and this screen protector makes it feel like the crack is not even there.  Solid and strong protector and was easy to place on the screen.  Anti Glare and Anti Fingerprint works great.
0.94450265	0.7510873	"The instructional videos were quick, to the point, and most of all accurate. I was able to ""professionally"" install my screen saver the first time out without bubbles or dust. Sure glad I didn't accept a major carriers professional installation of the $25.00 model they wanted to sell me."
0.85429025	0.6786637	This review is for both the Anti-Glare, Anti-Fingerprint and HD screen protector.First I ordered the Anti-Glare screen protector for my iPhone 5. I loved the feel of it but realized when I compared it to my iPhone 4 with another screen protector (not made by Tech Armor), the 5 actually looked more blurry despite having a retina display. It wasn't a huge deal, it's just that the iPhone 5 is an expensive device that I want to enjoy and take care of.So, I contacted Tech Armor and asked them if I could return or exchange the Anti-Glare screens to get the HD ones. They replied quickly and said they would send me the HD Screen Protector--free of charge! I didn't even have to send them back the Anti-Glare screen protectors!I love the HD screen protector. While occasionally it does leave fingerprint residue, it's similar to how it would show up on the screen without a protector. I really can't even tell it's there.One note about installation, the Anti-Glare screen was slightly easier to install, but I think that's because the material is slightly thicker and therefore more opaque. As the HD screen protetor is more transparent, it seems it was just a little more thin and not as easy to maneuver onto the screen. But I was able to successfully adhere both screen protectors within one or two tries.If you're deciding which screen protector to go with, consider how much you appreciate the clarity of the screen versus the feel of the screen.
0.8655664000000001	0.7531288	Easy to put on and didn't get any bubbles. I've had it on for about 2 months now and haven't had any problems.
0.9569731	0.6508148	Easy to apply. Quality is good. Fit very well. One thing is that you need to like the Frosted glass screen protector. It's not super clear but no fingerprint. Overall, I like it!
0.9989375	0.86880136	I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good these screen protectors look and feel.  Also very easy to install. The price is excellent for the value.  You won't go wrong with these.  I plan to order a Tech Armor screen protector for my wife's iPod Touch.
0.94566363	0.77367806	I carefully reviewed all the other products available and chose the Tech Armor.  I only used 1 from the 3-pack and it applied very easily for me.  There is absolutely no pixelation or distortion or reduced colour hue issues, or any issues at all.  My husband couldn't even tell it had already been applied to my iPhone.  My only critiscm is the enclosed cloth square actually junked up my screen with lint galore instead of clearing it.  Instead, I used the special eyeglass cloth cleaner you get when buying eyeglasses, which worked like a charm.  The instructions were small and not very dark so it was a little difficult to read, otherwise the instructions were easy to follow.
0.91414756	0.88233423	Over the years of having smartphones, I've tried countless numbers of screen protectors, and these are honestly the best that I have ever tried.There were no instructions in the pacakage, so I made the mistake of trying to install the first one without them. DON'T do this! Take 60 seconds to watch the video on their website. At the very least, simply pay attention to the tiny numbers on the stickers on each side of the protector. The side labeled #1 is the side that goes face down on your screen. Side #2 will be the one that you will peel off after installation. My first one was ruined because I didn't know this. On my 2nd attempt, I took the advice of another reviewer and used a small piece of Scotch tape on the base of the phone (right under the home button) to secure the protector in place after aligning it on my phone. Then followed the instructions from the site and used the small cardboard squeegee to roll the protector onto the phone while pulling the bottom-side backing off of it. On my first attempt, this left me with a small air bubble near the home button due to a small piece of lint that I missed. I was actually able to peel the protector back off the phone from that area and remove the lint with the same piece of Scotch tape I used to secure the protector to the phone. The protector went back on just as easily as it did the first time, and with no lint!The cutouts leave ample room for the earpiece and flash, and the texture feels like nothing is there. This was a relief, as I was afraid that these would have a tacky-like texture similar to Zagg protectors.As for the review that said there were scratches all over the protectors when they arrived...I'm inclined to think that they did a bad install. Mine too looked like they were scratched upon arrival, but the scratches were on the protective layers of the film, not the actual protector. I've never received a set of protectors that didn't have those scratches.Overall, these are a great buy! I paid about $7 for this package of 3 via Prime shipping. I ruined one, have one on the phone, and one on reserve. I couldn't have asked for better quality or value! I highly recommend these if you are looking for a quality set of dry-install protectors.
0.9856398999999999	0.68174356	This product was fantastic! I love the matte look, no glare and it's smudge free. I always had to wipe my phone after use, but not anymore~ Very happy with my purchase.
0.8774116	0.61574125	"The screen is very bright and clear made it more enjoyable to watch the movies with iPhone5.  I wish I would have gone to their website and watch the ""how to apply"" video first before I apply the first one.  So, I had to toss one of the screens during the process--my bad.  But I have one left and will definitely order more.  So, go ahead buy the product and then go to their website and watch the video.  It will help!  [...]!"
0.92483926	0.7113548000000001	Great screen protector, the item works and I have not seen any bubbles. It is a very useful item and I was able to save the other 2 screen protectors and just use one.
0.9756870000000001	0.76253814	I ordered the anti glare version, but was not sure whether or not I would like it on my shiney new iPhone 5 (so I also ordered the clear version just in case).  The size of the screen protector and all of the cut-outs fit the iPhone 5 perfectly. So far, I like the anti-glare and fingerprint resistant version a lot and, at least for a while I probably won't use the clear version. My only complaint, and this applies to all iPhone screen protectors I have used, is that it is always difficult to get these things installed without a speck of dust coming from somewhere to mess things up. Despite having installed many screen protectors on my family member's iPhones, it usually takes me two tries to get a dust free installation.  Thank goodness that they come in a three pack, because I invariably mess up the first one I install.  The price of this product is very reasonable, so I don't mind wasting one every once in a while to get a good installation.  I see no reason to choose the more expensive more famous brands and will recommend Tech Armor to my friends.
0.27686024	0.45429084	The screen protectors are OK but not as smooth when moving your fingers on the screen as I was expecting. I mean they do the job and that's OK but I was expecting an easier gliding I guess.
0.9446986999999999	0.7071994	I have applied several screen protectors that came with Otter Box iPhone cases.  Inevitably I ended up with a bubble or two or peeling corners.  My husband's most recent one ended up so bad he asked me to replace it, so I bought this as the most similar item I could find.  I was excited to realize that Tech Armor's product came with directions which actually *explained* clearly how I could most successfully apply this protector to my phone.  Having read comments and reviews I picked up another tip or two (install the protector while in a steamy bathroom to avoid dust in the air from becoming trapped and creating a bubble).  Otter Box only provided a small, three image pictogram for directions...not clear at all.  (BTW- I LOVE OtterBox cases, so don't think I'm slamming them...I just had problems with their screen protectors).  Anyway- by following the directions I have now successfully applied protectors to my phone and my husband's, and I have one left over for the next time I decide one needs changing.  The two I have already put on are practically blemish free (ok- I'm not perfect!) and are really not visible or interfering with the function of the phones. I'm pleased with this product!
0.10605487	0.42601943	I like the product description and was thrilled when my boyfriend bought it for me but I have to say, it is the most frustrating thing to apply. I have gone through all three protectors and finally stuck with the last one because I want protection despite the annoying bubbles. I applied as directed in the instructions but still there are bubbles. Though the product is affordable, I am not sure saving the money is worth the frustration of applying them.
0.9875646999999999	0.7942039000000001	Easy to put on, came with instructions and a guarantee.  These people mean business!  I put my phones through a lot, so far no scratches on my actual phone screen and a few scratches on the protector.  Which means, it's done it's job.  good thing i have a couple extras  :)
0.9982544	0.8269975	easy to put on and very good quality and price. protects screen really well and it is a perfect fit.
0.13413429999999998	0.40097272	I really wanted to love this item and it certainly is a quality product.  Unfortunately for me, it was really difficult to apply even after reading the instructions and watching the video.  I ended up throwing it away because after just peeling the protector for use, dust would inevitably get trapped from the surrounding air.  A person needs all the extra protectors for how many tries you need to get it on correctly.
0.97039723	0.76240337	I ordered these screen protectors and thought that I wanted the matte ones. However, when I received them, I didn't really like them. When I contacted Tech Armor they were really responsive and had a replacement set of clear protectors sent out to me the same day--no charge to me. Excellent product and excellent company!
0.88669455	0.76321346	The Tech Armor screen protectors are a nice product.  They are not overly sticky so re-application is easy.  They do what they're supposed to do which is protect the screen, and the matte finish is really nice.  If you're used to a glossy screen, the very slightly less than smooth screen takes a day or two to get used to, but the anti glare is totally worth it.The price is fantastic at $2 per protector, however my shipment was delayed several days which was a bit of a bummer and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
0.17871505	0.6240659000000001	"the protector was easy to apply onto cleaned screen.  It has been on for a while and is not peeling up or bubbling.  Fit well over the phone ear/mouth speakers (whatever they are called) and don't block an functions.  Addendum:  I have had the same Tech Armor screen protector on my phone now for several months and it has not frayed or bubbled.  With that said, I do also have an inexpensive ""cover"" that may help the edges stay in tact."
0.60625035	0.6346935	Easy application (though there is one minuscule bubble that seems to be impossible to get rid of). The screen is still clear and easy to read. However, if you have a white iPhone, this is a dark screen protector, so it may seem a bit weird with the white Home button and opening for the camera with the white/black contrast.Still, it works as intended and I would recommend!
0.9782893	0.7718682	I like this screen protector, it does the job and no bubbles, its not as glossy but it fits perfect and it protects your screen.
0.9133165999999999	0.7397205	The product was pretty easy to apply and I'm glad that there is a warranty (part of the reason why I purchased it). It comes with specific, helpful directions and tools to help you attach the screen protector. So far, I have not had any problems with scratching or peeling. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because after using the phone for a week without a protector, it seemed like the matted screen took a little bit away from the retina enhanced colors. I would still recommend the product, though.
0.9971819	0.7825122	It's easy to put on, and clear on the phone. It comes with the tape to remove lint, and a card to use for smooth application.I really love this and the best protector I have used yet.
0.9968167	0.6916845	Bought this item to cover all the phones in my family, kids...wife..mine...my dads and my moms great item to have
0.803134	0.5660161	i just got my iphone, and i bought this for my screen protector.  i did it twice.  i used my first protector as practice.  it actually turned out alright, but i'm a perfectionist.  my second one was perfect.
0.99172187	0.73794854	Love this case! It is excactly what I needed to keep my phone in while running and/or walking the dog.
0.9869933000000001	0.7751461	Love these screen protectors.  Decided to try them as they came with decent pricing with a case I ordered from Amazon.  Cleaned the screen with a dry towel then with the supplied lint free cloth and slipped the cover on.  No bubbles or anything trapped underneath so it looks great.  The cut matches the phone well as long as you take care to line everything up.  Came in a three pack so time will tell if I need to do it again.
0.99769366	0.8278457	Great product, great seller. Works perfectly and is barely visible on our iPhone 5. Definitely helps with preventing scratches on the display.
0.9956966	0.7730139	best prices around, awesome color, easy to put on, has a matte screen so it looks even better on the i5
0.03858161	0.44202179999999996	The application stickers did not come off easily, and left sticky residues on my daughter's phone. It has been collecting dirt and getting blacker since I put it on. I tried a second one, and it still came out the same way.
0.05513376	0.5890901	Very unhappy.Pros: I found it easy to apply.Cons: The biggest flaw in this is that the area cut out for the front camera lens is HUGE. The lens itself is a small circle but the screen protector has a HUGE oval cut out for it. It's like they just changed the dimensions for the iPhone 4S version but didn't bother to change the details. There reason I can't complain is that the picture clearly shows this HUGE hole but I just assumed that if something was manufactured to fit the iPhone 5, it would do so in all aspects, not just the overall width and height.  Another huge flaw is that this screen protector very clearly does not cover the entire front screen. I don't know if it was meant to be one of those that are compatible with those ultra-tight phone protectors but since it doesn't say that in the description, I wouldn't have known that was the case. A minor con is that this screen protector definitely shows fingerprint smudges.Overall, I am going to try and return this one and pay much, much closer attention to the fine details. Although, it not covering all the way to the edge of the screen could hardly have been known without the company mentioning that.Sigh...
0.9924376	0.83416784	The best privacy screen I have ever owned! The privacy screen does decrease the screen brightness (which is actually a plus for using your phone at night) but it efficiently provides privacy from four directions without significant interference with screen resolution. as promised. Great value!
0.99872077	0.8268572	Great product at a very reasonable price. I watched the installation video just to be sure that I installed the screen protector properly.  It was really very simple.  Glad I got this and I recommend it to anyone looking to protect their screen.
0.9506571	0.8506283000000001	I. The product is as good as it gets for screen protection - it is clear like the sceen without the protection (if you follow the directions and put it on correctly, you won't be able to tell it is there)II. You get three for a very good price (i already went through one since scratching accidently)III.  The vendor stands by their product with lifetime warrantyIV.  Excellent Customer Service and communicationFor those that think the cut is incorrect around the front camera and ear speaker, it is cut that way because there are sensors hidden on the phone in that area (when i first went to apply one, i thought it was cut incorrectly.Pros:  The product goes on without needing any liquid ++, it is clear, can't tell it is there once you use it a bit after applying, comes off very easily and leaves nothing behindMinor Cons:  doesn't cover the entire screen 100% - it would be nice if it went edge to edge, but it is about 2mm short in totalTip - after wiping the screen with the included cloth, use compressed air to gently get any remaining dust off before applying.  I applied mine bottom up, centering the home button first.  Also keep the cloth handy since it takes off smudges and finger prints easily from the screen protector.
0.65294534	0.73548263	I must say that TechArmor has excellent customer service, and they're eager to honor the lifetime warranty if you have the slightest complaint.However, I guess my problem is with anti-glare screen protectors in general, and not just this one. I'm not usually very picky about these things, but you *will* lose a lot of the brilliance of the retina display with this protector. Images and icons look muddier, and fingerprints are not easy to remove.So if like me, you're not too worried about glare, I would recommend you buy a clear screen protector, and save yourself and TechArmor the hassle.
0.8757014000000001	0.62154603	I didnt realize there was 3 to a pack so i ended up sharing with my niece and they are easy to install and nice to the touch its like nothing is on the phone
0.99493766	0.7067749	Best screen protector I ever used.Easiest to apply by far. NO bubbles.Does the job. Buy it with confidence.
0.7933677	0.7185798000000001	Very easy to install. Hole align with phone button, camera lens, and ear phone slot. There is no hole for the noise adjustment on the side of the ear phone slot, but I don't think it has made a difference on its functionality. I'm happy with this screen protector. It does the job!
0.3915953	0.5274800000000001	I really wanted to find a product that would not reduce the resolution of my screen since that is one of the reasons I paid so much money for an iPhone. This product maintains the beauty of the iPhone screen while going on very easily. I was able to avoid screen bubbles on my first try.
0.49409288	0.5201858	The idea of this product is fantastic!  I only wish that it were more user friendly.  I read all of the instructions and watched the video, etc.  However, I went through all three of the screen protectors and STILL had dust particles under the third one.  I also found that the &#34;tools&#34; supplied only held up for the application of the first protector.  The dust cloth is great on the first use only, after that it tends to deposit whatever it removed.  Again, the idea of this product is amazing, I purchased it to avoid the OtterBox &#34;oil slick&#34; problem.  Unfortunately, it did not solve that problem as I had read elsewhere that it might.  I gave a three star rating because other people may not have the difficulty I had with installation.  I really had high hopes of this product being amazing.  I would recommend it only if you are having a professional install it.
0.82820225	0.6387241	I chose Tech Armor for the anti-glare, as well as for the priceI did have an Apple employee apply the screen (against their policy, as it was purchased elsewhere!),'just to make sure.'I did purchase an Otterbox, so technically the Tech Armor was redundant.I'm still quite glad to have it there!
0.9992893	0.8815876	Screen protector was very easy to apply on new iPhone 5. Does exactly as described. Provides Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint with a matte finish. Will be ordering more of these. Highly recommend.
0.9820194999999999	0.6888148000000001	Great screen protector. Just need to take your time installing, make sure the screen is really clean and there is no dust in the air. Great feel to the screen, don't even notice the film.
0.9921593000000001	0.75887305	I love this screen protector. It is made of good quality material and was very easy to adhere. Will purchase again in the future.
0.978816	0.88267267	I've only had the protector on for a few days, so I can't say much about it's durability, but it was very easy to apply relative to other protectors I've used.  I did run the shower in the bathroom before attempting to apply it, which seemed to keep the dust down, but what helped the most was the included tape.  Despite my care, I had a couple pieces of dust under the protector after initially placing it, but the provided tape worked perfectly to lift the protector and remove the dust.  I have zero dust under it now and it looks great!  I used Zagg protectors for a while, but they are a royal pain to apply and I found that over time the plastic actually stretches and distorts so it no longer fits the screen correctly.  Love this one so far!In terms of appearance, it fits my screen perfectly and the matte finish does help with glare.  It definitely cuts down the fingerprints, but does not eliminate them; I can definitely still see some smudges on the screen but they are much less visible.
0.99552023	0.8645735000000001	I think all screen protectors are too expensive for what they are - but this was lower price than others and works great. I recommend the anti-glare over others - easier to read and keeps screen clear of finger prints.
0.99859095	0.8325776	I used this screen protector for my otterbox defender case, since the screen protector it comes with is too fuzzy and gets that oil steak look. Now my screen is CRYSTAL clear with NOOO bubbles. Easy installation, Highly recommend, best screen protector I've ever used.
0.9948938	0.82869136	This screen protector was very easy to install. Air bubbles are easy to get out and screen is crystal clear. Great way to protect your iPhone.
0.9973085999999999	0.85892344	The sales people at the AT&T store put this on my iPhone 5S last night. They had never seen this brand before and were curious about it's quality, ease of use, thickness, look, etc. and were very impressed. I had an iPhone 5 with a Zag protector before and it didn't feel nearly as nice as this one does. I had no idea that it could make this much difference. Seems like a small thing, but when you feel this one, you will know what I'm talking about -- it feels great to the touch! And the matte finish is excellent. I highly recommend this product.
0.8963021000000001	0.81833345	I've had several different brands of screen protectors for my iPhone 5, and this was the easiest, most reliable to install I have had.  The fit is good, and I didn't waste any screen protectors trying to put them on.  (I went through a whole package of another brand - unsuccessfully.)  This also worked well with my low-profile case.  The dust removal cloth that was included generated about as much dust as it removed, but it was great for removing stubborn spots, and I used a can of air to blow the lint off.  I'll buy these again!
0.98709434	0.77953273	This is a nice matte finish screen protector, even from the start it was smooth.Also installation was very easy.
0.98930264	0.797285	I resisted buying my iPhone 5 screen protectors for months; this is an amazingly effective product at a reasonable price.
0.98419154	0.77326035	Love this Anti-glare and anti fingerprint screen protector. The cost was reasonable for 3 and it came within a week of purchase. Thank you.
0.97623247	0.844427	This screen protector is a great deal for the price. It went on smoothly with very few air bubbles - and those were easily smoothed out. It only has one tab on the protective film that is thrown away, so you won't have to peel a sticky tab off the actual screen protector which usually results in either air pockets or a sticky smudge on your cover.It is indeed smudge-resistant and feels smooth to the touch rather than slick.3/pack for $7 is pretty great too.I don't know how long it lasts, as I've only just received them but the perfect fit is likely to help it last longer
0.9989268	0.897639	Screen protector fits phone perfectly. I paid $15 for a 2-pack from the apple store for my 4S, and they didn't even fit this nicely. Easy installation, no bubbles! I prefer the matte finish because they resist scratches and fingerprints. Package included a cleaning cloth and tape to remove lint prior to installing. Very pleased with this purchase!!
0.99512625	0.8281253000000001	I really like the texture of it.  It makes using the IPhone much easier and the anti-glare works great.  It does not impact using the touch screen.  I would highly recommend it to protect your phone.
0.9859796999999999	0.7937794	These are fantastic! I have been using for two weeks and still do not have a fingerprint and the screen is easy to read. Best screen I've ever had.
0.99849916	0.8370226000000001	3 months so far and works great with no problems and easy installation. This was a new I phone 5 and it fit perfect.
0.64442873	0.6160517	The screen protector is good for the price.  I'm sure other cases out there would be less likely to get air bubbles in them as this one is prone to do that.
0.60889816	0.58808005	Everything looks good except for the cut outs for the front camera and mic/receiver. There's too much uncovered space on the left side. Would have been fine if it were centered with equal uncovered space on both sides. The other two protectors that came with the pack have the same issue. Unless it's really supposed to be like that? The cut out for the home button fits perfectly but not the others? 2 stars for that. I sent an email to the company but haven't heard from them yet.Update: Changing my rating to 5 stars! The cutouts are elongated so they don't cover the sensors (which you can't really see if you have a black iPhone). Good to know tech support check the reviews here since I still haven't received a reply when I e-mailed them directly.
0.9939519	0.8148991999999999	The screen protector has precise cutouts.  More improtantly, it's so easy to apply within a minute without any single bubble.  Great buy!
0.9361191999999999	0.67869544	Great product and speedy delivery! I like how I was able to properly put on the screen so that it doesn't come off. I was debating on going to the mall so they could 'professionally' place my screen protector on without air bubbles, etc. However, the little device that came with it to help flatten the screen (almost looks like a pick) worked like a charm. Thanks!
0.91924596	0.7933332	This is a nice product and came in a very professional box.  The instructions and tools provided made installation a breeze.  However, the screen is scuffed in multiple places already and it is less than a week old.  Also, I did have to turn up the brightness on my phone ( as expected) but it also makes the image much less clear therefore overriding the amazing visuals Apple put into the design of the iPhone 5.  Overall, a good product that protects the screen from scratch and Sun.
0.98012775	0.8385408999999999	This is absolutely the best screen protector I have used - and I have tried many.  I had a great screen protector on my iPhone 4.  I put it on the first week that I bought the phone and left it on for 2 years.  I couldn't even tell it was on there and it didn't scratch once.  When I upgraded my phone, I knew I wanted a screen protector and I wanted the same one again.  Unfortunately, because I have an Amazon addiction, I could not find the screen protector order in my history and I could not remember what brand I bought.  So 5 different brands, 2 sketchy months without and $35 later, I FINALLY stumbled across the Tech Armor product and recognized the company logo!  It is so easy to put on, it looks so clear, the price point is great, and it does not take anything away from the phone's fancy screen.  I kept ripping the other screen protectors off because they felt too rubbery or looked foggy or actually scratched - this screen protector is nothing like that.  I honestly can not even tell that it is on the phone and it is great protection.
0.97552073	0.751253	I love this anti glare screen protector and its doesn't get all smudged and greasy from my fingers and face.
0.9985069	0.8227315000000001	This works great! I love it! Has saved my daughters phone from scratching and cracks. I would for sure buy these again.
0.9961576999999999	0.8412594000000001	gets finger prints fast other than that it was easy install and great no airbubbles or whatsoever fits the screen perfectly
0.014911263999999999	0.32606685	These things suck, skinomi screen protectors have worked for me in the past and I should have gone with them again rather than switch things up. NEVER AGAIN will I buy tech armor, waste of money!
0.18575412	0.40704298	After hearing good things about this screen protector from my sister and reading all the good reviews, I decided to purchase it. I was very excited as I wanted a matte cover.Unfortunately, things didn't turn out well for me. Although I watched the instructions video and did everything that they recommended, my screen protector had 10 bubbles that wouldn't go away no matter what I did. It was a frustrating, and I didn't want to use another protector because it cost me $7 for three covers! The screen kept bothering me so I just went ahead and used my second cover. Well, that didn't turn out well either! The bubbles were still there and really annoying. So of course, I decided to try one last time...and am not very happy with the result. I am left with many bubbles and no more covers. It's very disappointing. I'm sure that these Tech Armor covers are good quality, but for me that wasn't the case.
0.98824924	0.82604325	These are fairly easy to apply - just make sure you read the instructions and get the different sides of the protector right. Protects the screen very well.
0.001743257	0.2820388	I wasted money on this cheapy tech armor screen protector. I used all 3 screen protectors and all it gave me was many air bubbles. This business is horrible because I emailed them explaining what happened and they never emailed me back, terrible service. I don't recommend this at all, so don't wast your money on it.
0.0065591335	0.4069389	Very disappointed I ordered this while with other packaging and I didn't get it at all, got the other orders I ordered but not this one... I paid for this screen protecter why haven't I gotten it yet? Very very disappointed ethier you guys stole my money.
0.8107449000000001	0.6371826	I like it a lot, the screen lasted me long and help a lot with people staying out of my business
0.041579902	0.52900964	Really bummed about this. I read in some of the other reviews that the size was slightly off, but that is an understatement. It is waaay too small to fit the iphone5 screen properly and the finish on it isn't great either. I ended up having to buy a proper matte finish screen at the Apple store, so this purchase was a total waste of time and money.
0.9908227	0.7130086999999999	I love this screen protector, Matte is the best! The screen is a bit tricky to apply, but if done right, the phone looks great!
0.91595197	0.7210959	The screen protectors are perfect. They were easy to put on and they are always easy to clean. After a month, there is only one small scratch in the screen protector, but not enough to warrant replacing it just yet.
0.99951935	0.87317675	I've always used the super shiny covers and switched to this antiglare. Love it! It's a quality product and the instructions are very specific. If followed correctly, the shield goes on perfectly and fits my iphone 5 perfectly. Highly recommend!
0.98688185	0.8336302999999999	I have put on a lot of screen protectors for myself and customers and these are among the easiest to install since anti-glare are thicker than a normal plastic screen protector. Much better price than buying from a cell phone retail store, too!
0.13400999	0.4646843	The only problem with my order is that the protective film that covers the screen protector was only on side 1.  It was not on side 2 so therefore it is easly scratched when trying to get the air bubbles out!
0.6415009	0.7383149999999999	Works as described. Reduces glare and fingerprints. Looks slightly strange until you get the hang of it, but I actually prefer it on the smaller screen - I went for the clear version for iPad mini.
0.00023505092	0.44675803	Case leaked and ruined my iPhone 5c. Product is not waterproof. Does not work well. Disappointed I am not able to return for refund.
0.77983093	0.5711904999999999	This product worked as expected only difficult part was to get perfect coverage. Did need more then one try but came with extras. Good price too less then local cell store.
0.9620426999999999	0.7912283	Just had real problems with another screen protector.  Tried yours and found that it went on easily without bubbles.  Terrific!!
0.9699367	0.7618965999999999	I love the covers, but it is a rather steep learning curve to apply them. It's good they come in packs of three, as you can mess up the first one, apply the second, then have a third as back-up. Still, the price is great, and the protection is second-to none. Between this and my elago S5 case, I have light, minimal protection for under $20.
0.9568049000000001	0.73743916	This screen protector can be compared to the Ghost Armor screen protector. It was easy to install and very good quality!
0.9990094	0.86634624	Simple to put on with no bubbles, just read the directions. Protects screen very well at a very reasonable price.  Highly recommend.
0.03443396	0.45021263	Not a very good idea come to mind when trying to use this product, it slides constantly on the screen blocking the speakers and catches a lot of dust/dirt.Shipping was fine.
0.9914867	0.8262370000000001	Installation is easy and well documented, the cover is very high quality, and there is plenty of help if you run into installation issues (such as not pre-cleaning sufficiently before installation).
0.95449895	0.7470434	My adult daughter is using one of these right now and so far she likes it a lot. So far there has been no scratching and the touch screen functions fine. Clarity is great. She basically doesn't know it's there. Since she has only used one for a week so far, I'll update this review later if I notice any substantial benefit or significant failure.
0.9624028	0.7881673	These screen protectors are awesome.  I have used different ones in the past and always had to deal with the air bubbles.  These went on without a hitch and not a single bubble was present.  The entire procedure took less than one minute.
0.7599266	0.64251196	Yesterday around 6PM I was traveling on the freeway and struck a stranded semi truck tire (with metal rim and everything) going at least 70. My vehicle rolled 3 times before landing in an ivy embankment. My truck is totaled, my back window completely shattered out causing everything to be tossed out, including my phone. Bystanders pulled over and helped me. I asked one to look for a phone, and they found it, covered in dust/dirt with full on glass shards sticking into the screen protector. I thought my phone was scratched beyond belief, just of the mere look of it. I got home after the hospital, took off your screen protector, and found absolutely NO damage. No scratch AT ALL. My phone still looks new after rolling 3 times and glass shards still IN IT. Your screen protectors are LEGIT and I JUST purchased a new pack of 3 no more than an hour ago.I will most defiantly recommend nothing but Tech Armor's product to friends and family.
0.9850675999999999	0.716904	Easy thing to do.  You have to be near crazy not to!  This is a great value product and represents a small investment to protect an expensive product!
0.96710646	0.8209046999999998	Bought of packet of two. Easy to put on, and with the use of the soft card to push out any bubbles.The feel of the cover is a good blend between the high gloss covers and anti-finger print covers. Though it still does leave fingerprints. Does the job and a good buy.
0.26368305	0.7339943	"If all vendors doing business today were as caring and involved with their customer base as Tech Armor has been, especially Joseph, there would be no such term in business as ""churn rate"".My screen protector arrived as scheduled and I was delighted with the ease of application on my new iphone5. I had feared the worst - recalling other nightmare stories with other like products of dust, bubbles and a bad over-all result and final appearance of the device afterward.My experience of applying the Tech Armor iPhone5 High Definition (HD) Clear Screen Protector was one of ease and first attempt precision. The only concern I had after application was about the positioning of the two cut-outs on the top of the Tech Armor High Definition Clear Screen Protector surrounding the front camera and the front-facing microphone. They appeared to be off-center and misaligned.I was pressed for time and a bit concerned so I composed a fast email to 'support@techarmor.com' asking for help. Within 8 minutes of sending, Joseph was calling me on my phone to address my concerns. WOW! and this was also on a Saturday morning!Joseph explained that this was NOT a manufacturing defect but was done intentionally, based upon Apple specifications, as to not cover up the face sensor which turns off the face of your phone when it is against your face talking to avoid disconnections or other operational problems. The sensor on the black phone is difficult to see, but it is there and should it become covered up, it could effect phone performance.Tech Armor, I believe, is in the process of developing an even thinner screen protector which would allow these cutouts to become more aligned with the phone features.I can't say enough about the quality of these screen protectors. There is absolutely no decrease in screen touch sensitivity and you can tell that they are made from high quality materials which will fully-protect the front of your devices. When you combine that - with what I would describe as world-class customer service - The question then becomes: Why would you consider purchasing from anyone else?"
0.90984887	0.7216066	It works and my iphone 5 is the studliest phone on the block now... look out other phone cause boom here comes mine.
0.9098845	0.7055347	It works as it is, it is nice that it comes with couple extra ones.I messed up when I put frist one on.
0.8116366	0.7567872	Does its job as a screen protector on a budget. The holes don't line up correctly but they do provide enough space so that they don't block anything important. Very few bubbles after protector is put on. I recommend this due to its inexpensive price.
0.99556017	0.80076456	I had an issue installing the screen protector on one of my phones and had small bubbles around the ear piece.  I wrote to customer service and they sent me a list of different techniques and ways to install the protector to avoid those issues and wanted me to be 100% satisfied so they sent me a replacement.  I am very happy with the product and you do not notice it at all and it fully protects.  Highly recommend!
0.9696739999999999	0.5923194	WOW!!! I just replaced my Screen protector for a Tech Armor, and I have to say the HD is so clean!! I usually don't write reviews, but I have to for this product dAMN! highly recommend it!
0.9912846	0.7828354999999999	Works and looks great - no issues installing and it comes with 3 so I was able to my/ my wifes phone and still have a spare.
0.9989495	0.88517094	Bought Tech Armor for my iphone 5 on amazon.com. However I did not follow instructions wheninstalling the screen protector and screen protector. So, the screen protectorended up peeling off from edges. I contacted Tech Armor and they immediately pointed out the mistakes Imade while installing and sent me a free replacement without any cost. They were prompt in sending thepackage. I installed the new one without a problem after reading the instructions and watching online videoon youtube. Thanks Techarmor for great customer service. I am pleased with the product and service and orderd two sets of Tech Armorfrom Amazon.com for my Iphone 5 and my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3. They are great and pretty decently pricedcompared to some other brands where you have to pay over $20.00 for just one screeen protector where you willget three screen protectors in a Tech Armor package . I wouldrecommend this product to anyone who is looking fora screen protector for thier cell phones at a very decent price. Please dont forget to read instructions and watchthe installation video and follow the instructions. At the end you will be a very happy customer.
0.87546813	0.7734156	After I made a mess of the first screen protector (I did not read the instructions or view the installation video), Tech Armor was kind enough to send me another 3 pack.  I just now installed it (after reading and viewing the instructions!)It is absolutely invisible and adds no artifacts to viewing the phone or viewing any screen display.  It is completely invisible.  There were very few bubbles to remove after I carefully installed the shield and they were easily removed.The screen protector does not interfere in anyway with the Laza iPhone 5 Jelly Gloss Case that I also ordered from Amazon.  The Laza slips on easily over the Tech Armor shield and the two make a perfectly invisible system of protection that shows off the beauty of my white iPhone 5.
0.7103550999999999	0.6687333000000001	I'm ashamed to say I was a big fan of the Zagg products.Ever since my Nano 1G got scratched beyond belief I've been afraid to purchase just about any electronic device without also purchasing the corresponding Zagg product. For awhile there, nothing could top Zagg, but honestly I've gotten more and more disenfranchised with the Zagg products as they are too costly, too hard to put on, and scratch way too easily despite the claims to the contrary.Enter the Tech Armor protectors. I'll admit that I purchased it based on the following reasons:1) unhappy with Zagg2) ridiculously high number of 5 star ratings of the product3) what I consider to be a very fair price4) 3 protectors instead of just 1I figured I'd give it a shot. If I screwed up the first one, hey, I have 2 more to go, and if I don't like it, hey I can blast them on Amazon right?So here I am, not blasting but singing their praises. These screens are very nice, insanely easy to put on (got it on the first try), *look* much much better than the Zagg protectors and my iPhone looks way better too. The only downside that I note is that they seem to grab the finger prints more easily than the Zagg ones do, but that's small potatoes. Nothing a 2 second wipe with your shirt won't fix. Not sure if they scratch but so far, no problems and if it does get scratched up, hey, I've got 2 replacements.So my faith has (at least temporarily) been restored in the world of screen protectors, but this time I'm running with Tech Armor, sorry Zagg you had your shot.
0.88887846	0.79064023	This privacy screen is great! It SHOULD go without saying that ALL privacy screens diminish color quality. It is just a sacrifice that needs to be made to uphold the privacy of your documents.It should ALSO go without saying that if you want to purchase ANY privacy screen that your brightness settings do have to be set lower for it to work to its fullest potential.I have bought numerous privacy screens and this one is definitely one of the best I've ever used.
0.99424535	0.8698151	Ordered these for my iPhone 5 and can't be happier. I cleaned my screen using the microfiber cloth (included), then used the lint tape (included) to remove stray particles of dust, then installed the screen according to the instructions. After using the cardboard squeegee (included) to coax out the bubbles (then removing the top layer protection film), the screen looks simply amazing! The cutouts for the button, speaker, and camera are perfect. I can't even tell that I have a screen protector installed, it's that good! I'm very impressed!
0.9988940999999999	0.8583054	This was very simple to put on and it has so far stood the test of time. My phone is usually in my pocket with my keys. Tech Armor holds up well. This is the best one I've found if you have an expensive phone or iPad to protect.
0.0056805015	0.53281164	the plastic gets dust and lint under it before you can even start the process. using the hard paper to smooth the bubbles results in SCRATCHES on the cover. so why provide it?waste of 6 dollars, these reviews HAVE to be fake. please listen to me. this is just awful, didnt work at all like i expected
0.46054527	0.72016966	I have only purchased PowerSupport for each of my iPhones and now that it seems they are no longer around, I needed a equal product. I purchased another brand first and was disappointed in cut of film and quality. Needed something that was the Matte HD finish and didn't leave fingerprint smudges, like the PowerSupport. While it's almost impossible to not have smudges, this product comes in very close to it. I still think the PowerSupport product is the best out there. However, for what I spent on this Tech Armor product, I can not complain at all. Great product, precise fit, barely leaves smudges and was delivered in half the time given. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a smartphone and is looking for a quality screen film to compliment it.
0.9397523999999999	0.8107469	This is definitely the best screen protector I've purchased. The only reason i did not rate it 5 out of 5 is because I'm still looking for a protector that will not make the screen look greasy and show every finger print. Functionality wise this protector is very high quality, they provide a great cloth to get the screen nice and clean and they also provide a lint remover which is awesome. This is the first protector i've put on flawlessly the first time and it is thanks to the professional installation tools they provide in the box (the cloth, the lint remover and the card to even it out and smooth.When they make the actual protector out of a more smudge resistant material that is closer to the way the phone is without any protector I'll rate 5/5. For now, this is 4.8999 out of 5 ;)
0.9510607	0.77723396	went on easy with no bubbles and there was everything I needed to make sure it went on without bubbles....it kinda gets greasy finger smudgy streaks but no more than any other screen protectors.  I would recommend this and I wish they had one for the back
0.36819494	0.68717825	Definitely a must have to help preserve your investment without compromising the user's experience, once installed correctly. This screen protector proved itself after the phone slipped out of my hand and dropped &#34;face first&#34;'on to asphalt, landing on a protruding stone. My heart stopped, by I regained life when I inspected the phone and noticed and indentation the protector, but the screen itself was unscathed.
0.92137635	0.81866646	I originally had a clear protector on my iPhone, but when I got my new phone I was looking for something different. This protector went on easily and gives the screen a smooth laptop touchpad feel. I feel that my finger glides more easily and doesn't stick to the screen as much as it used to.The only downside is that it slightly reduces the clarity of the Retina display, but overall it is a nice experience.
0.42008950000000006	0.56925607	I purchased a screen protector with my iPhone when I first bought it.  I don't recall the brand, but Verizon applied it at the store (I've applied many on my various iPhones / iPods over the years, but they offered, so what the heck?).That protector lasted almost a year before it became scratched and I felt it was time for a new one.The Tech Armor protector had enough good reviews that I decided to give it a try.  The package came with three, and that turned out to be a Very Good Thing.Tech Armor advertises themselves as the best protection against scratches.  I'm not so sure.With my previous screen protector, my phone made it nearly a year without a hint of a scratch on the glass.  I even dropped my phone while hiking in the mountains once, watched it tumble down rocks, and while the corners and back of the phone are scratched, the screen remained pristine.I had hoped for the same from Tech Armor.Within a week of applying the first of the three included protectors, I discovered huge scratches across the face of the protector.  I honestly don't know where these came from, as my phone hadn't been dropped and when I carry it, there's nothing else in that pocket.  Never the less, the scratches were there, and obscuring the screen.  I guess the screen protector needs a screen protector.  *shrug*  Since I had two more, I figured I'd just move on to the second one.I applied the second screen, burnished out all of the bubbles, and called it good.A couple of days later, I notice a spec of dust.  I to wipe it off.  It's UNDER my screen!? I have no idea how, but a spec of something wormed its way under the screen protector and was now lodged against the glass.  I took off the screen protector to discover that whatever this was had managed to scratch my screen!!!Nearly a year with zero damage to my glass, and now we're barely two weeks into the Tech Armor pile of fail and not only am I on the second screen, but it's allowed my phone to be scratched!So now, here I am on the third and final protector in this package.  They say &#34;third time's a charm, but honestly, I have no idea how long THIS one will last. I'm already researching other options.All in all, I'm less than impressed by this product.
0.17361632	0.59461033	Problem number one with this product is the sticker they put on it. When you remove it he leaves a residue.Problem number two is you cannot view the phone with polarized sunglasses.
0.9372523000000001	0.7727778000000001	The product arrived on time and is good for the price.The Screen fits iPhone 5 perfectly.  I was able to apply the screen without any hassle.  Didn't have to waste any :)
0.11128154400000001	0.5045411	While the product looked good on the phone after it was installed, the screen protector gets scratches easily and displays them prominently. Due to this, it gives a clumsy look to the appearance of the phone.I have used a Tech Armor product before and I think it had a matte  kind of finish. It was much better than this in terms of the scratches but it had a dull  look.
0.8117939000000001	0.50203574	Fit better than what I got from my mobile provider. cannot believe i have to add more words to post
0.93943286	0.8061191	These screen protectors are so much nicer than the oily sheen of the thin ones!  I see no distortion of the clarity on my phone and these will protect much better than the others!
0.89944607	0.7427753	I had tried two oh her types of screen saver and ruined both putting them on. I ordered the Tech Armor ones which arrived very quickly. I was dredging the task of putting the screen protector on with out bubbles but how wrong was I. It was so easy cleaned the screen with the cloth provided applied as directed and there wasn't a single bubble. The quality is brilliant I would recommend this product to everyone I just wish they did on for the iPad air.
0.89446694	0.84017324	"I just finished a marathon session of applying new screen protectors to an iPhone 4, iPhone 3, Kindle, and my new iPhone 5, using a variety of brands so I think I have a pretty good frame of reference for rating this Tech Armor product.  I originally gave it a rating of 3 for three reasons:1) One screen protector wasted: after spending laborious minutes making sure everything was lined up and all bubbles smoothed out and dust specks removed, I lifted off backing #2 using the provided tab and whoa!! the whole screen protector came off with it!  I've never had this happen before with the many screen protectors I've applied.  And yes, I DID remove backing #1 first.2) I applied the second screen protector without incident but after looking at the finished result, noticed that the top cutouts for the camera & light sensor are waaa-y off to the left.  See my photos.  It looks messy.  The cutout for the home button, however, is perfectly precise and aligned.  Go figure.*****UPDATE - Tech Armor very promptly provided an explanation of why the cutouts are skewed to the left (I own a black phone, so this was not apparent to me).  All right, thanks, but it doesn't mean that I have to like the look of it.  I've added back one star to my review.  Still, I am not the only one who has commented on the cutouts - Tech Armor would benefit from including this information in the package to avoid this kind of misunderstanding.""The elongated hole is due to the proximity sensor. Covering that sensor with a screen protector could affect your phone's performance and prevent the phone from detecting that you are speaking on it.The elongated hole above, near the camera, is designed to leave the ambient light sensor uncovered, again to not affect the phone's performance. For iPhone 5 black phones, it is difficult to see this sensor which is understandable why you would question the width of the cutout but it is clearly visible with iPhone 5 white phones.""*****3) Tech Armor includes a little card to smooth out bubbles.  But the card is made of cardboard, and degrades quickly.  Luckily I had some better-quality cards made out of plastic from other screen protector kits.The quality of the screen protector is standard - no better or worse than others I've used.  It's very clear.  Not smudge or fingerprint-proof.  I notice the slightest bit of drag when using my finger or a stylus to swipe.  UPDATE:  After having this on my phone for a while, I really don't like the feel of the screen protector when I swipe.  And it's true - it seems to be a magnet for attracting lint, smudges, and fingerprints.  So, my ultimate rating would be between 3 and 4 stars.P.S. My tips for applying screen protectors:1. Work in a well-lit area so you can see the slightest speck of dust on your screen.2. Clean the surface of your device well with the provided lens wipe.3. Right before applying the screen protector, hit the surface of your device with a blast of compressed air (you know, the canned air you use to clean out your computer keyboard).  They do this in the Apple store when they apply your screen protectors for you.4.  Before you apply the screen protector, have ready a piece of scotch tape.  Then apply the screen protector S-L-O-W-L-Y and pay attention to any bubbles that form - if you see a dot in the middle of a bubble, you've got a speck of dust or lint.  Lift the screen protector back up and dab the scotch tape on the sticky side of the screen protector to remove the speck.  Hit the surface of the device with another blast of compressed air.  Continue to apply slowly and watch for lint/dust specks.  Air bubbles are okay - those can be smoothed out later.  But if you see a speck in the middle of a bubble, you'll want to remove it right away, or live forever with that tiny bubbled speck on your screen.5.  I read somewhere that you can use your shower to create a dust-free setting.  Turn on your shower full blast on hot and supposedly the steam will temporarily create a dust-free environment.  I tried this, used up a full tank of hot water, but don't know if it really made a difference.Good luck!"
0.77111304	0.72254443	The application of the screen was easy and came with a cleaning cloth, a card for smoothing out bubbles, and a card for removing lint from the sticky side. The cut-out at the top (by the speaker) doesn't line up perfectly with the screen but it doesn't obstruct the hearing or anything.
0.5759821999999999	0.46138959999999996	My son found this great product, priced right.  Shipment received within a week.  Good instructions, even better video on how to put on the protectors.  1st time didn't work, 2nd time was better, so I emailed customer service before I used my last one.  I received a response almost immediately.  We emailed back and forth and not only did they offer to send a new package, they replied back to every question asked.  I don't follow instructions well, so after reading and watching, I asked about the sticky residue.  I receive a very detailed response explaining the purpose of the adhesive.  I now understand they are suppose to be there. I received the replacement package within another week.Very happy!
0.5763908	0.53404826	It has got good instruction. But there is some sticker missing (number 2) instruction mentions about that but I couldn't fine one!!Easy to put it on tho.
0.9972257999999999	0.74872386	Screen protector shipped on time and fits in size on my iphone. THey are high in quality. Happy with my purchase. Thanks.
0.98529565	0.79043704	This screen protector was better overall than others I have tried for different devices.  It was easy to apply (though the directions didn't quite match up to the product, almost like they were for a previous version) and I love the matte finish.  My only complaint is that, with the matte finish, I think I might lose some of my screen quality.  Overall, good purchase.
0.9858289000000001	0.60403305	I was so amazed with this protector. They given clear instructions on how to apply on the Iphone. Overall I like this protector.
0.5141406	0.6380903	"Bought these for my new iphone 5 because Apple wasn't smart enough to notch out the areas for the speaker and home button on the OEM screen protector so I could just use that. I've wasted 2 of the 3 screen protectors trying to apply it. They do NOT line up perfectly with the button/speaker no matter how much you try to line it up before. Same problems as others with the bubbles which I got those out easy enough by peeling it back up slowly and using the ""squeegee"" card (which, by the way, will scratch the protector) but when you pull it back up is when the little particles get underneath it and then once you get the air bubbles out you now have bubbles from the debris. Not going to even bother attempting to put the 3rd one on."
0.8978127	0.63203686	This product is very good. Moreover, they stand by their word customer satisfaction. I had a problem while using the screen protector and customer care advised me with some steps and I followed them. But some how there was still some poblem and the customer care had replaced the product. I used this product for a month and it looked good so far without any bubbles and gum. Overall this was a good product.
0.27472383	0.585756	I am very happy with this screen protector. It did take me 2 tries to get it on right. You really need a dust free environment to put it on. It's not that difficult once you get the hang of it.. peel #1 off slowly while putting it onto the screen.. align the bottom and the edges properly.. scrape out the bubbles before peeling off #2.. boom! it worked like a charm! i dont have a single bubble on my screen. when i brought my phone to AT&T to change the sim card, they even asked if i would consider buying a screen protector cuz they couldn't see it was on!
0.33870512	0.6171438	It's cheap, it does the job and has a similar feel to it compared to the iVisor Moshi.It's not bubble free but it won't pop up when you apply pressure to both sides.
0.9659803	0.77253294	ease of installation and the performance seems to be still the same no complaints from the wife, she is the user.
0.15814391	0.4674626	Perhaps its just me but I had a hard time getting this onto my iphone (new) without air bubbles. After multiple unsuccesful tries, I tried the one that came with my iphone protector (Incipio Dual PRO) and it worked the first time.
0.0022860467	0.4478896	The instruction sticker they put on the clear screen saver leaves a horrible sticky residue that you CANNOT get off!  Its horrible!!!
0.998899	0.88387597	My husband is a bit of a phone geek and has been comparing various features on our phones.  He was surprised and impressed that my phone was so much easier to read in the bright light than his was (which I have to admit & attribute to the Tech Armor screen protector).  It really does live up to it's anti-glare statements and it was much easier to stick on my phone (without getting any air bubbles) than any other screen protector I've used.  I'm very impressed and would definitely buy again.
0.9822273000000001	0.80191433	The Tech Armor Screen Protector seems to work very well so far.  I don't notice any difference in touch-sensitivity on my iPhone 5.  I carefully followed the installation instructions online.  I couldn't keep my hand completely still, to precisely place the screen protector, so ended up part-way lifting it off to reposition it slightly, which resulted in a slightly better placement, but in more bubbles which took at least 10 minutes to carefully push away with the provided cardboard bubble-pushing tool (actually that was a little bit fun).  So, now there are no more bubbles.  Even though I still didn't succeed in perfectly placing the screen protector (it might be mis-positioned by a millimeter or so), for all practical purposes it works totally fine (it's just that the iPhone is so beautifully designed that I wanted to keep it perfect).  I am happy to have my iPhone 5 protected, and it seems to be a very good product.
0.3439355	0.45435983	I installed my 1st screen protector without realizing that there was a second part to remove, therefore I had many bubbles, which I could not remove.  I then just received your video and installed the second screen protector and it worked beautifully.  However, I had to throw out my 1st attempted screen protector.
0.59175426	0.5706669	Was a little hard to get on straight. But it's good when it's on. No bubbles in it. But used them all trying to get it on
0.9946388	0.8282441999999999	I purchased this product several months ago for my iPhone 4 & love it so much I ordered more for my new iPhone 5. I went without one on my iPhone 4 for a long time because i didn't like the feel of other protectors. But after starting to notice a few hairline scratches i knew i had to find something. I love the feel of this protector. It's very smooth & feels like nothing is even on the screen as with a lot of screen protectors. And the price is great for a pack of 3! I had read some of the reviews on this about applying the product & I will say that someone suggested doing it in a steamy bathroom to help minimize lint & bubbles which worked great. My screen protector went on smooth & perfect with no problems. I rarely do reviews but am a avid reader of them before making a purchase so I felt I needed to let people know my good experience with this product. You will not be disappointed.
0.9262775	0.7859673	This screen protector was really easy to put on, and I've never had a problem with it. It stays finger-print free and does what it says to do!
0.73895335	0.7847941999999999	The cutout for the top front lens of my iPhone 5 is off center but the edges do clear the margins of the lens.  I am using it in conjunction withPoetic Atmosphere Case for Apple iPhone 5 5th Generation 5G (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon) (Clear/Gray).  The case is a snug fit so some of the edges of the screen protector gets crimped up and you can see bubbling at those edges.  However, I've not seen any dust collect underneath and the bubbling is not so noticeable over the white parts of my phone.  The bubbling may be different for a black iPhone 5.  I am otherwise satisfied with the clarity of my display and feel confident about preventing any scratches to the screen underneath.  I know the screen is not very scratch resistant as my husband has an iPhone 5 without any protection and it has sustained a small scratch from normal use (kept in jeans pocket, occasional drops to the floor).ETA:  After reading some other reviews, I see that I was in error about the off center cutout.  There is an ambient light sensor located to the left of the lens and should be left unobstructed to work properly.  The sensor is not visible on black iPhones and is neither visible on white ones.  The proximity sensor to the left of the earpiece is visible on white iPhones.  The cutouts for these is similarly good, where the edges clear the margins of the sensor and earpiece very nicely.  See photos I've uploaded.
0.054396063	0.44880820000000005	Ended up not using it.  Took on and off 2 times before I said to forget it.  I'll risk the screen on my new iPhone.
0.9980280999999999	0.8516719000000001	My new i phone 5 is a big investment and may be clunking around in my purse so I got the Tech Armor screen protector.  I have had problems with bubbles and alignment when installing previous protectors, but the Tech Armor was very easy to install and no bubbles at all!  My Belkin protective case went on with no problems.  You can't tell that the protector is on...looks great.  Oh, and the pack of 3 protectors comes with a card to remove bubbles(if you should have any) and a nice cloth to clean the screen.  I highly recommend this product.
0.9355198	0.63220197	I don't like how dull everything looks through this cover.  Get the High Def version and you'll be much happier.
0.99809027	0.8844799999999999	Purchased this for Iphone and Other smartphones as well as for my Ipad Mini, Love it !Cannot get better than this, also comes in various anti finger print which I recommend, but this has High Defintion, very clear.So it is up to you - you can go with others but you will find yourself replacing the screens over and over.This was easy to place and I bought one for all the phones - for my family members and no bubbles or marks.Like any other screensaver you have to clean the surface before placing the screen saver on and pay attention.Also it comes 3 in a pack, with different versions for your personal use.I have replaced all my screen savers with Tech Armor and it was well worth it.Have not replaced a Tech Armor screen as yet and the way it looks it will be a new phone or ipad or electronic.Will always go with Tech Armor. The proof is in my 4 phones and 3 ipads.Thank You Tech Armor.
0.551283	0.6762453	It's a good product from a reputable company.  Watch a few videos on YouTube on how to install, first time, using tape to position and keep it in place, before peeling the back off and sticking it it down. Just be careful pulling it back up again, if you're trying to remove a piece of dust caught underneath, because the shield might get a permanent fold, but you do get three covers in this pack.  The anti-glare is great for reading in sunlight, and if the screen looks a bit dimmer, then just increase the luminosity a little.  Also, no fingerprints visible after two weeks of use.
0.9581046	0.8032218000000001	This privacy screen is great. It is easy to apply, stays in place, and does the job. When I had it on, I asked my friends if they could see what I was doing. They said they knew I was doing something on my phone but couldn't tell exactly what it was. I take public transportation and this deters people from peering into my phone while on the move as well. I had to get my phone replaced and they couldn't take the privacy screen off. Guess what I did?...Came back here to order another one--that's how great this product is.
0.9965825	0.76748335	product came on time, 3 screen protectors, and works well. So affordable for the price I paid and product is in great quality.
0.12196037	0.36773205	This product does not work well as it bubbles and scratched my phone. Its worth going to the mall and having the apple geeks put an apple protector on your phone so it will be guaranteed not to bubble and scratch...
0.98204803	0.7677683000000001	I have used screen protectors before for other phones, relatively this one is easy to put on my iphone. There.
0.97025126	0.7327499	The tech armor screen protector is easy to put on phone. The video on YouTube is educational. It showed me things that were useful when putting on the screen protector. I recommend this protect to any and everyone. But I'm not sure how the lifetime warranty works just yet.. :-)
0.9984466000000001	0.8984493	"These iPhone screen protectors are wonderful and frankly, so refreshing to see.  They are the ""old fashioned"" screen protectors you'll see that don't cost $20 for a single protector that's supposedly better made, which come with an extra squeegee to get the air bubbles out and spritzer to clean your screen.  No gimmicks with this - it's the screen protector, cloth, and smoothing card.  Everything is completely functional.The screen protectors have a great finish to them as well.  They are easy to install and really require no instructions.  Basic, just as it should be.  Everything fits perfect on the iPhone, very easy.I almost always get something underneath the screen protector when I'm installing it however, no matter how careful I am.The screen protectors have been very durable and have been able to take quite a beating.This is a great value and so hard to find nowadays, where most screen protectors literally need a small manual to put them on your phone!"
0.4891215	0.7062236	on an angle, it doesn't really obscure the screen that much. it darkens it (both for the user and for their neighbor). looking straight on, the screen is slightly pixelated, like older cell phone screens used to look, so you don't really get the advantage of the retina screen. however, that would be completely excusable if the protector actually BLOCKED neighbors from seeing my screen, but it doesn't. it darkens and blurs the screen a little, but even at an extreme angle, it's possible to make out what I'm seeing on the screen. the final nail in the coffin is that it is quite thick, and you can feel its edge around the home button (especially on the 5s which has a slightly concave home button to accommodate the print reader). it wasn't expensive, and since it's re-usable, I might put it on if I'm going for a hike or somewhere that I need strong protection for the glass, but other than that, it's staying off.
0.9974209	0.8332826999999999	Excellent product- best screen protector I've used so far. I always get a little nervous putting these on but this was relatively easy to install. I found the Dust Removal Tape (included) very helpful and the film went on without many bubbles. I did have to peel back the film 1X because of a dust particle but I followed the directions and removed it easily (peel back film w/ tape, pick up dust with another piece of tape, let film fall back in place, smooth out- done!)This film provides a super sharp/clear image & a very good value for 3 for under $7. Only wish it was smudge-free but that may be asking for too much. Highly recommended.
0.9940903	0.8361993000000001	These screen protectors work extremely well especially for what their price is.  They were super easy to apply and seem very durable!
0.96466225	0.8155323	this product comes with three sheets, no sheets for the back of phone. pretty easy to apply. very clear, and pretty good fit.
0.9041152	0.7430308000000001	I have used many fake, cheap iPhone 5 protective screens before because I wanted to save money and thought the screen didn't really matter as long as it had a layer over it to protect it. I was wrong. Every single time I used the cheap stuff the edges won't align and you only really get one good try at laying it down on your phone. After I did somehow manage to align it, there would be tons of air bubbles with single strands of dust on it! The phone would look hideous! After all that, I decided to spend a few more dollars to get this Tech Armor and I really really recommend it!!This is how easy it took for me to install the tech armor: I unpeeled the sticky layer, use scotch tape on one side of the phone to make sure it goes down aligned, let go and this Tech Armor kind of just guides itself down to create a perfect seal without dust. There was not a SINGLE strand of dust trapped in any air bubbles.This thing applies itself. Now that it's applied, I love repels oil but still lets my screen shine bright and clear. I do not work for this company and I do not write many reviews because I never felt compelled to but this product is really the best!
0.10745287	0.50378424	I ordered this case couple of days and got it delivered today. I had really high hope for this product, but it is kind of a let down. The installation process is very easy. The problem was the protector made the screen looked fuzzy (not the usual darkness because of privacy screen). It mostly noticeable when using an app where the background is white (i.e safari, calendar). Disappointed with the screen!
0.93413866	0.51839894	Took the second try to get this properly applied, but now that it is on, you would hardly know it.  Directions for application are concise and customer care/follow-up has been excellent.
0.8853889000000001	0.5870122	I got the screen protector for my friend. And he said it's really good for touching and cell phone games. You deserve it a lot.
0.99605435	0.83921874	The kit includes useful supplies to ensure a perfectly smooth application given a relatively dust-free environment and patience.The cutouts for the camera and speaker appear larger than necessary, but this is purposefully done to keep the less apparent light and proximity sensors uncovered as well.The Clear Screen version has great clarity and has remained clear and scratch free through thoughtful daily use. Durability does not seem to be an issue.I've certainly been satisfied with the screen protector and feel like the kit has an overall noteworthy value.
0.5504573	0.50567365	I just got the screen protector took all 3 for me to get it on with the screen protector on it still seems crystal clear only bad part about it is I have no more screen protectors.
0.9911734000000001	0.81232274	Very easy to put on the screen without getting any bubbles. Love it on my phone, makes me feel safer about not getting scratches. Good deal.
0.9788971	0.8149877	I carry my phone in my pocket and it is exposed to abuse from key fob.  Wanted to protect the screen without losing any functionalability or looks.  As they suggested, I visited their site to ensure proper install.  Installed the film and you can't even tell it is on there.  Lays flat, no air bubbles.  Silky smooth.  Very happy.
0.64722204	0.6357347	Like cases, I'm not a fan of screen protectors. They tend to feel worse than a glass surface and it seems like they're more difficult to wipe down. With that said, I was getting fed up with the micro scratches that were forming on the oleophobic coating on my iPhone. It got to the point where my aversion to screen protectors where outweighed by my minor OCD against scratches.The screen protector isn't an exact fit but I haven't found an exact fit screen protector yet. They all seem off by a certain amount. But this particular brand did throw in 3 in case I goofed up plus it feels like &#34;hard plastic&#34; instead of the tacky film on other brands.I'm happy with it and would recommend it to others.
0.9855323	0.8140675	Great Product from this company, the pack has three protectors but you will never need more than one, unless you cut it.  The protectors are thick easily applied and look amazing.  My only complaint is that is smears easy but that is easily solved.I bought this screen protector first and since then bought the Privacy protector which in my esteem is even better, that protector has a matte finish that keeps the smearing from happening and is also a thicker protector but just as sensitive.  You will only get one protector if you do get the Privacy one but it is all you will need. It is by far the best 360 degrees 4-way privacy protector there is.
0.9906925999999999	0.68020374	I like this product and nice instructin. It has three protectors so can be mistaken. I would recommend others. Thank you
0.14790079	0.48850182	The price was good and i bought it. I used it for one day. It is not good. It makes my screan look worse
0.046988487	0.23853302	I thought this product was something completely different, next time I would full read the product details because I make a purchase.
0.99942327	0.81084895	I've seen  screen protectors at the Apple store for $15, I decided to go on Amazon and price match.  I stumbled across Tech Armor and decided to try it out.  Application was fairly easy and now I am at ease with my screen getting scratched.  Nice screen protector and a great value.
0.89344966	0.6373522	This screen protector has a nice matte feel to it and doesn't leave prints. Screen protectors can be hard to install without leaving bubbles but I was able to get this o e on without any!
0.99704194	0.8157099	I purchased this screen protector along with one for my iPad.  I no longer have to worry about a glare or fingerprints.  I will definitely recommend this product to others.
0.9825895	0.7609438000000001	This HD screen protector is by far the clearest I've ever seen.  No one noticed it's installed until I actually pointed it out.  The pack includes three protectors.  The first one got bad, but I think it was my fault.  The second one was installed properly, and it's just amazing.  Highly recommended.
0.9237953000000001	0.5355474	Simply perfect !  My only advice - use plastic card ( credit card ) to put it on the screen instead of provided one. My friend saw it and asked me to give her info , so she can replace hers ( new one !!) - it how she liked it. Strongly recommend  !!!
0.94016445	0.6788821999999999	I've ordered these types of protectors before for other phones and they were always a pain to put on. But usually would save me a ton of money rather then having it put on professionally.I'm so happy with this one, it took me maybe 5 minutes to prep it put it on and have it look perfect! No bubbles !!
0.9574231	0.7959859	The matte finish is great.  It was easy to install.  I did get one small bubble and tried to get it out unsuccessfully.  Great product for the price!
0.99618524	0.8342732	Easy to install, the screen is protected, I have no air bubbles under the protector.  Very pleased with Tech Armor
0.94779235	0.6456331999999999	Way better than zagg in my opinion. I get my money worth and it does it job. I would recommend it.
0.99731433	0.72613245	Great product! Though it cost more, the quality was well worth it. I will definitely buy this product in the future and will recommend it to friends.
0.81164813	0.77109706	Like others have said, these are not the easiest to put on, but once they are on they look and feel great.  There are no issues with the touch screen working once they are on and they seem very durable.  It took me a couple of tries and after a month, one of the corners started to come up.  For the cost and how great they look and work though, I will try it again.  They are far less expensive than anything else i have seen that works the same.
0.85344553	0.6596873000000001	It was super-simple to put this screen protector on. It may have helped that I was such a noob, I hadn't yet removed the protector that came with the iPhone (I thought it was a screen protector, and didn't know why my photos were coming out so lousy - doh! the protector that came with the camera was covering the lens!), so there was no dust on my iPhone screen.Not only was it a breeze to put this screen protector on, it fits perfectly under the Otterbox Commuter I put on immediately after putting the screen protector on. It's still working great after a few weeks; and I have a couple of spares in case this one gets too dirty or something.
0.88874125	0.52298254	This screen protector was easy to apply, the best application experience I have had yet!  It doesn't dull the image on the screen.  I can't say anything about the longevity because I put it on today, but I am very happy with it and can't wait to see how well it lasts!
0.036028653	0.48274229999999996	The screen protector doesn't fit correctly on the screen. I have a bumper case, the screen protector peels up in the corners when I need to take the cover off and if the cover starts to come off on 1 corner and i have to put the cover back over the edge of the phone.
0.9781511	0.79240954	They were exactly as description. Just didn't go on as easily as most. They are anti glare and nice to the touch. Perfect for a iPhone 5 screen.
0.9575083000000001	0.6721965	Beats the price of T-Mobile similar offering by a mile. Does the job. Have had no complaints. I don't have an iPhone.
0.89011073	0.5333778	I bought the Matte screen protectors but ended up not liking the feel to them. I figured I just wasted money but contacted the seller and let them know I didn't quite like them. They mailed me a set of clear screen protectors at no charge. Talk about fantastic customer service! I love the clear ones... thank you guys so much! I'll order from you again for sure!
0.31041685	0.57227135	This screen protector is fully matte. It feels pasty to the touch but it makes the screen look less hd than it is.It did protect from sun glare and finger prints though.
0.71324617	0.6568036	Went on super easily just make sure it's aligned the first time or you may get bubbles after that. But over all it looks nice
0.9840431000000001	0.8452091999999999	I first got my iPhone 5 in December, and bought the ZAGG screen protectors with a lifetime warranty and free replacements. My first cover started bubbling in a month or two, and my replacement peeled off within a week...and the FREE replacements aren't free, you still have to pay shipping and handling and all you get with each package is one screen protector which is incredibly difficult to put on.  I decided to try these because I would get 3 screen protectors for the cost of shipping and handling of the 'free' ZAGG replacement, and I love them! So easy to put on, and they work great. They have a kind of matte finish, so my phone doesn't glare in bright lights, not even outside. I will NEVER go back to the ZAGG products after this.I also have this brand of screen protector for my iPad mini...again, works great. Highly recommend!
0.23094055	0.5248543000000001	I couldn't get the protector on without getting so many bubbles underneath that it was visually distracting and difficult to use in certain lights. And it's rather thicker than I was expecting, so I couldn't quite get the edges to fit under or flush with my case (LUVVITT FROST Soft Slim Clear TPU Rubber Case), so it was always peeling back when my hand brushed against the edge.  Maybe someone with superb manual dexterity could position it better, but I gave up and tossed it.
0.9746529	0.81014276	Basics: It does exactly what it says. Can't even tell I have a cover on my phone. Easy to apply.Back story: I got my first iPhone 5 for Christmas. I ordered a case from Tech Armor and some generic screen covers from some other company. I loved my tech armor case so much that when my iPhone was stolen in Feb, I reordered it right after getting off the phone with my insurance company to get my replacement phone. I had such a good experience with Tech Armor that I also ordered their screen protectors. I had left over screen protectors from my first phone, but they gave my screen an odd rainbow appearance when the screen was off. Summary - Tech Armor is awesome! And so prompt!
0.94614303	0.7622529	Bought this with the Luvvitt FROST Soft Case and both provide protection without the bulk or clunky feeling some of the other cases provide.
0.9287763000000001	0.84827244	I was looking for a screen protector for my new iPhone 5.  I wanted something to protect the screen but something that is basically invisible.  This is it!I wasn't crazy about applying the screen protector myself, but I decided to try this one.  The price is so low that even if I messed it up, I wouldn't be losing much money.  The package came with 3 screen protectors so I had 3 attempts to get it right.  I did it on the first try.  Read the tips and watch the video on their web site (the URL is in the directions that come with it).The only minor negative that I encountered is that the included cleaning cloth seemed to add tiny dust or lint particles to the screen as often as it removed them.  Still, I was able to get the screen clean and apply the protector quite easily.  Also, the instructions say to call the company if you have a bad experience.  It sounds like they would rather send you a new product than to have you go away unhappy.  I'm glad I didn't have to test that.Note that if you are looking for anti-glare, this isn't the right one.  However, it doesn't add any more glare than the original iPhone screen.  I highly recommend this screen protector.  Outstanding product, excellent value.
0.92698354	0.6057823	I can't rate the durability of this product yet but it was easy to put on my phone, no bubbles or issues and I forgot it is even there.  I hope it works well if actually needed!  :)
0.9275247	0.8304418	I tried these after my girlfriend got the same type for her phone.  I've always favored Zagg covers because they strengthen the glass and make it indestructible.  But in addition to be far cheaper, these provide a really nice, almost flawless look.  You really have to look close to even see that they are on.  They're extremely clear and have the same reflective quality as the original glass.  They're a little tricky to line up and I went through a couple before getting it right (especially with the iPhone's front facing camera), but nowhere as difficult as the Zagg.  And there are three in the package so getting it wrong at first is no big deal.  Definitely take advantage of the dust removal tape.  I didn't at first but I'm glad I finally gave it a chance.
0.85280085	0.6549605	I originally got the matted version but it ruined the screen sharpness but this one is perfect...Buy it no regret
0.21286329999999998	0.4034474	You get what you pay for...My sons phone didn't survive when he drop it with this screen protector in place. Very disapointed
0.998834	0.8425088	I was amazed by this product. It is excellent. Easy to set on the iPhone and is almost invisible. I would definitely recommend to everyone. Repels dust and does not retain fingerprints.
0.9734209999999999	0.7707928000000001	Product came to me very fast, it came with everything it said it would. Putting it on was a bit of a pain but i eventually got it. Although it looks like it is peeling of, it hasn't at all and it still works fine. It also has a nice feel to it. Very well worth the price. Highly recommended
0.9996408000000001	0.9129136999999998	Seems like a great screen protector. It fits perfectly, the clarity is excellent and there's no reduction in touch screen sensitivity. They provide a screen wipe and good directions for applying it (they even have an instructional video on their website), so I got it on nice and straight and without any air bubbles. Yay! Tip: Their how-to video shows both their iPad and iPhone screen protectors and they have different instructions for applying each one. I actually used the iPad method (even though I was applying an iPhone screen protector) and it worked really well.
0.10382134	0.42942804	Maybe it's just good luck, but I had no issues applying this to iphone5, no bubbles and all the holes lined up, and I didn't even have to use the 2nd and 3rd one.  Recommended.
0.98111534	0.83110094	No way! This protector was sooooo easy to put on the phone! No bubbles or messing around. Provides great protection and maintains the sensitivity integrity of the touch screen.
0.006887585	0.6027843	I purchased 2 packages for my new phone.  First the the tab labeled remove would not come off and left a sticky residue. Second they would not adhere to my phone. Slide right off.  So much for a bargain. Waste of money.
0.98762953	0.76308024	Super easy to apply! My first time using and I had no bubbles or wrinkles. I would recommend this product.
0.9881793	0.7487783	I have used this on my iphone 5. Works really great. It is absolutely transparent and doesnt make me feel that there is a layer sitting between my finger and iphone screen. Certainly would recommend.
0.99533933	0.7949558000000001	I love my Tech Armor anti-glare screen protector for my iPhone 5. It was super easy to put on and it works so great. I have a real issue with finger prints and since putting it on my phone I have a nice clean looking phone. What smudges I do get, wipe right off with a soft cloth. My only (tiny) issue was that the touch screen is not quite as sensitive now. But I am getting used to that. Thank you for a great product.
0.9012071	0.7512717	Had no problem getting it on the phone. I like the anti glare because it doesn't show the finger prints etc. The package came when promised and is very good quality. No issues!
0.9196044	0.7903781	I just installed my screen protector. It was so easy, they even have a video on the tech armor website on how to install. I can hardly even tell I have a screen protecter on my iPhone 5 the only place I can see it is around the camera area, can't notice it at all around home button. I can see my display perfectly clear. It also feels very smooth to the touch, to be honest if I couldn't see it around camera area I would not know it was there. In the past I have used Zagg screen protectors, and was not happy. To be fair I did not try their HD protectors. But installation was difficult, I could see the Zagg protector around the home button and it really bothered me. They also felt rubbery. The Tech armor is everything that Zagg was not. I would recommend Tech Armor to any one who wants to protect their screen from scratches, with out jeopardizing the look and feel of their beautiful iPhone 5. Hope this review helps.
0.9980129999999999	0.8222805000000001	Great product easy to apply , protects the I phone cuts down on glare. Great price, came early. Would recommend this supplier
0.9960989	0.8076489	These covers are worth the price I paid.  I am very pleased with how they protect the screen on my expensive iPhone 5.  Yes, I will purchase these again!
0.9904146999999999	0.8139151	This was my first time trying tech armor on a phone, and as such i was a little worried. What if it didn't go on right? What if it doesn't have the right cut outs for the iPhone 5? I had no need to worry! I received my order on the Monday after the iPhone 5 came out and promptly set about putting it on. It was very easy, there was no need to spray the screen protector and your fingers like some products i can think of *cough* invisible shield *cough* and with the provided squeegee i was able to line it up in get it perfectly in-line on my phone in one go. I have had it on there for four days now and it looks great. I wouldn't know it was there at all but for the camera cutout. Look no further when searching for screen protectors for your new iPhone 5, this is the one you should be buying!!!Oh yeah and it comes with 3 screen protectors if anything should ever happen to the first one (not likely).
0.9948313	0.81884176	This was easy to apply and the anti-glare makes it easy to see the screen in the sun. Great value!
0.9930408000000002	0.8207435	Watch the videos for a quality installation.  Practice alignment and placement before removing the first film cover.  Installation in a somewhat humid bathroom to reduce lint.  Looks great.
0.98573947	0.7208941	Good choice who's looking for screen protector I recommend it for him. you won't be worry for scratches or finger prints on your screen.
0.9994818000000001	0.8944353	I was highly impressed with Tech Armor's line of screen protectors. I have them for the iPhone 5, Galaxy Note 2 and S3, and the HTC DNA. Every one of them is a perfect fit and I have never had any problems with air bubbles or fingerprints. And they last super long. I highly recommend this product!
0.0018960238	0.44026005	I would not recomend this to any one , soon as i put it on my phone it took me less then a minute to jank itRight off, its very poor quality, it does not make Your screen private at allAnybody can see what you're doing on your phone from any angle that they are on it just simply does not workAnd it ruins the way that your iPhone screen will look you will see black lines all over and it will make the screen quality look very poor and cheap and just simply ruins your phone do not buy it.
0.9936414000000001	0.92622375	I have always had the clear protective covers.  They were prone to fingerprints, they get oily and sometimes the sensitivity of the screen dimishes, etc, etc, etc....I decided to pull the trigger on this 'matte' screen protector and it's awesome.  No fingerprints, no glare and it gives it a real cool look that the clear protectors can't pull off.  Opening the package you receive a cloth, 3 protectors and a plastic/rubber piece to help with installation.  It's very easy to install.  You slightly peel off the backside plastic and place it on the screen and it practically lays itself without bubbles.As far as the cosmetics, it's hard to explain but with this 'matte' cover on the face of the phone it make it's look like the back of the phone.  A few times I thought my phone was upside down until I realized the home button was in plain view.  It basically gives the phone a very solid and slick look.  Another way of saying it, it doesn't look like glass with it on.  It looks solid and gives it a pretty cool look to the phone.PLEASE KEEP IN MIND WHEN BUYING THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR...  IF you like HD viewing and that is a HUGE priority with having a phone then expect to have that diminish slightly.  It looks beautiful with it on BUT it does slightly take away from the vivid HD appearance.  Again, if playing games or watching movies is your thing then it does slightly take away from the vivid, crystal clear experience.  Even so, it still looks beautiful and vibrant.Also, because it's a 'matte' finish, it gives the display a sense of depth to it.  The actual touch / feel / swiping feels great.  Very slick and never gets oil'd up by your fingertips.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this protector if you are a fan of the 'matte' finish.  Both my wife and I have it and love it.  Definite purchase!
0.0008693933500000001	0.60129374	These were not matte finished.  They did not cut glare.  And the paper tabs that you are supposed to remove did not come off cleanly and left an unsightly glob of paper debris and adhesive on the screen.  Simply a horrible experience.  Product returned.
0.8252803	0.7845629	Worked as advertised. The texture and feel is different and took a bit to get used to but overall its great. The glare is gone and an added bonus that I was not aware of is that it creates a bit o privacy. Viewing angles are smaller and you can't see the screen unless you are directly in front of it.
0.3572147	0.43009275	Does what it should and it came with the tools to make application easy! My only wish is that it had a protector for the back... I had to put a front screen protector there instead and it looks ugly :(
0.94911814	0.6672474	This was a bit of a challenge to place, but witha little patience its the absolute best cover in the market.
0.99543774	0.7991913	I just love this screen protector. I bought this for my iPhone 5 and could not be happier. There are no bubbles as almost every other screen protector has. I just replaced the one I received with my new OtterBox Case as it was far inferior to this one. I bought the iPhone 4 version as well and it works great. You can't even tell there is a screen protector on most of the time. It is great! Will only buy this brand from now on.
0.9591219999999999	0.70263743	I ruined two of the three screen protectors just trying to put it on, but overall this is an amazing product from a fantastic seller! Will definitely consider purchasing from this seller again!
0.5332029	0.7300861	If you like wiping off the screen of your phone all day long, then this is the screen protector for you!  Installation was simple and fit is excellent.  However, this protector collects more dust, finger prints and smudges than an un-protected screen.  It almost leaves a greasy, filmy coating on the screen. (yes, I was my hands regularly)
0.7050215	0.73581284	I think they work really great! I have one on my phone and one on my mom's phone. There are a few things that make it a 4 star and not a 5 star.1. After touching the screen, especially if your hands are greasy, the screen smears and makes it look a bit grainy. But once you clean it, you cant even tell there is a screen on it.2. The cut out holes in the screen for the camera and speaker for the front of the phone are way too big. The hole for the front button is perfect so why are the top ones not?3. I dropped my phone and a piece of the screen protector came off. It is on the edge of the screen, so its not a huge deal. Being on the edge of the screen also might be a contributing factor as to why the screen protector came off a little bit.But apart from those small things, I think this a good deal for the price.
0.98437023	0.76766735	I found this very easy to install on my new iPhone 5. I was able to install correctly using the first protector.  Also, I love the feel of the screen with this protector. It's hard to explain, but it is slick yet feels like there's a bit of friction.  Something about the feel is very pleasing.
0.88271815	0.7692462	I love matte screen covers because my finger sticks to the bare glass or on glossy covers which make it difficult to swipe or scroll on iPhones.  The matte cover solves for that issue but it doesn't look as &#34;sharp&#34; as a glossy (or no) cover does.  It's just inherent in any matte cover so it's nothing against this manufacturer.
0.030730695	0.44778275	I've used many screen protectors before .. for Gameboy, PSP, cell phones, etc... and I think I've gotten pretty good at putting them on, without getting fingerprints underneath them, or air bubbles, etc.  But for whatever reason - and I can't figure out why - these ones were impossible.  I wasted the first two in the 3-pack, just struggling to figure out which side was the 'sticky' side, because neither side would stick.  Meanwhile the more I struggled, the more dust and fingerprints got all over them.  The 3rd one, fortunately, stuck.  But with lots of air bubbles.  This was a big waste of money.
0.9980302	0.8166131	This product performs exactly as advertised. Lets me read in bed with less disturbing light toward my wife. Would recommend to my friends.
0.21161190000000002	0.42602527	"Took me going through the first 2 that came with it before I figured out how to correctly aply it not thats it on i reallly enjoty all of the features will look to contact to replace my 2 ""mess ups"" to put on family members iphones"
0.99949193	0.8886101000000001	Works perfectly great. I had no bubbles whatsoever. Super easy to install. The protector does not feel cheap like plastic. I like the texture of it. Most people cannot even tell I have a screen on because it looks so flawless. Highly recommend this. Worth the money.
0.81128144	0.7180253000000001	I waited four months after purchasing my new Iphone 5 before I put on my Tech Armor screen protector. I watched the short video at techarmor.com under the 'Support' tab three times to make sure I had the process down correct. It was a piece of cake to put on the screen cover. The final result even impressed my 35 year old son! No bubbles and my screen was as bright and clear as Swedish crystal!
0.9743181999999999	0.81386435	These worked much better than others I tried and are affordable too.  I would order more of these again for sure.
0.9837481	0.82669055	This is a great screen protector. It's crystal clear and if not for the earpiece and camera cutouts would be totally invisible. The surface is hard and feels much like the native iPhone glass which is wonderful compared to some of the rubbery options out there. Also i read somewhere that running the shower could help with the install. I did the application right after a steamy shower. My hands were super clean, the steam and extraction fan removed virtually all the dust in the air, and the added humidity made the install a synch! Try it out sometime. All in all love this screen protector.
0.9977174000000001	0.84875107	I use my phone outside and wanted an anti-glare screen cover for it. The installation video and instructions were well worth reading/watching. My screen cover went on well and I'm very happy with it.
0.5621961999999999	0.7360042	"First I'll start with the positive. This is by far the clearest screen protector I have ever used. It really maintains the Iphone's retina display while offering scratch protection. I had originally ordered the Techarmor 4-way privacy shield and wasn't happy with the purchase based on the diminished screen quality. Techarmor's customer service was beyond excellent and they actually contacted me to make sure they could make me satisfied with their products. As a result I received the 3-pack of these HD shields. I cannot express enough how good their customer service is.This screen protector would get 5 stars if it were easier to apply. Initially I thought ""why would they give me 3?"" and then figured I would give the other 2 to my family members. While I had good intentions, I went through all 3 shields before I was able to correctly apply the final one without issue. The main problem is that both the adhesive side (which sticks to your phone) and the swiping side (the side you use with your fingers) are covered with the same thin sheet of plastic by a sticker saying ""Remove Me"". To make matters worse the side you are supposed to remove first and place down on your phone is far more difficult to remove than the other. This caused me to place the wrong side down first and remove the incorrect cover rendering the shield useless. It wasn't until the 3rd try that I figured this out.Basically, the shield is great, it's quality, and the customer service is excellent. However, make sure you watch a couple videos before installation because they don't label the screen covers too well which can cause confusion."
0.016666412	0.42691480000000004	I purchased these screen protectors based on the large amount of positive reviews, that and they were inexpensive.  They were really clear but the protectors are made of a plastic that is somewhat sticky, it isn't as smooth as other screen protectors (the invisible shield line is smoother) and they all left a residue on my iPhone 5 after removing them.  The worst aspect of installing these protectors is that they would not sit flush with my iPhone 5.  It took me a while to finally get one of the screen protectors completely straight only for there to be a hair right in the middle of it.  I threw that one away and opened up the second screen protector.  I installed it fine but then it came up whenever I installed a soft gel case on my iPhone 5 simply because it wasn't sitting completely flush around the edges of the phone.  It was crinkled so I threw it away.  I couldn't even install the 3rd one as it never stuck to my phone.  I ended up throwing all three protectors away, driving down to a retail store, picking up different ones, and they work much better.  I don't recommend buying these as they are inexpensive for a reason.  I'm not sure how people are using these with cases on their iPhones as I could never get it to work.
0.9049436	0.77849054	Really happy with this purchase. I forget that I even have it on the screen. No loss in clarity or responsiveness. Was easy to put on. Very cleaver way I must say. Just take your time and use the tape they give you to get all of the dust particles off. No issues so far and you get 3! Good for general protection.  I don't know how it would do in an extreme circumstance, but then again, I wouldn't want to put my phone through and extreme circumstance. If you are looking for some good protection without sacrificing clarity. I feel this is a great product!
0.9706201999999999	0.6478092	I love the fact it is a dry install, unlike others were you have to spray the iPhone with some included liquid. The dust removal tape included is so useful as well. First time I had seen it. I wish the other vendors would include something similar. Some charge 5 times the price just for one protector, this came with 3, so if you make a mistake, you have 2 more chances.
0.874136	0.7691024999999999	This is an effective, inexpensive way to protect the top of your phone. The screens are easy to apply and replace if they become stained or damaged.
0.43239298	0.47125736	I like how you get 3 protectors in a box cause it took that many to get the thing on properly.  The only problem I have is that the two pieces of film that protect the protector don't tell you which side is the &#34;sticky&#34; or &#34;down&#34; side.  So I installed one upside down and didn't realize this until after I got it too dirty to use (that and it didn't stay on). Just a little thing but I think it would greatly help first time users.
0.99356115	0.7181293000000001	I love these screen protectors.  Easy to install, align, and get bubble free.  You have to really look to tell if I have a screen protector on my iPhone or not.  Love it.
0.9636097	0.66334975	Great deal, fast service. Just take your time installing. I like the fact that it can with 3 pieces to work with
0.9976311	0.7327459	Amazing Screen protector works great and is so High Definition you barely notice its on your phone! Overall great product!
0.9727485	0.8766693999999999	I want a screen guard to:1) Protect the screen2) Feel good to the touch3) Not dull the beautiful retina4) Not look dirtyI've used several different covers on my Android over the years.I tried the 'Tech Armor HD' on this iPhone first since it had so many reviews.This cover was very oily and I absolutely could not get it clean by rubbing on the shirt, pants, etc like I have always done.  Paper would clean it, but not cloth.I settled on the 'iCarez HD Clear' for half the price -- it is awesome.PROS- installation was easy enough and bubble free- very clear  (once you get it clean)- cutouts fit perfectly- feels good to the touch- good price  (although the iCarez is even cheaper)CONS- so oily it doesn't matter how clear it is
0.049960554000000004	0.6168918000000001	I was rather disappointed by the shimmer in the LCD.  I'm told it would go away, but its been a while.  Seems to loose some of the brightness too.
0.9982941999999999	0.8517585999999999	Quality materials at an awesome price.  Crystal clear screen protector with great touch sensitivity.  Easy to apply and had clear instructions. Be careful though - easy to get bubbles between screen and protector.  Not the products fault.  It just takes a smooth and steady hand !
0.9071165000000001	0.78906196	Applied this myself. Yes, I had a dust speck under the first attempt, but second attempt worked like a charm. My wife wants the third protector.  She got a matte protector, which she had someone apply for her at the store. When the phone is viewed from certain angles, the matte version probably shows fewer finger prints, but the clarity of the HD protector is fantastic.
0.96418583	0.7926129	Went on so easily....I didn't get any air bubbles!  Really like the anti glare effect...very smooth on the screen.  Very happy with the purchase.
0.67840207	0.72338784	Very difficult to install. No matter what I've tried, there are still so many bubbles and wrinkles. Very bad quality materials. Would not recommend to anyone.  I had to reorder another brand and it sticks to the screen perfectly on the first try without any bubbles AND for a much better price.
0.82840943	0.60497814	I didn't have a problem putting the screen protector on. It was fairly easy. I like that it looks like the screen protector is not even there. The only thing I don't like is that you can see all of the blemishes, like residual makeup on the screen but that may be a good thing because it reminds you to wipe the screen daily.
0.8378633	0.7720081999999999	Nice protection, doesn't impact visibility at all from what I can see.  It took me two tries to get no bubbles, but looks great and seems durable.
0.997123	0.8523284	My 16 year old is so rough on phones.  I bought her a new iPhone 5C and knew she needed a screen protector but she didn't want the case covering her phone.  I thought I would try this screen protector and it was very easy to apply and works very well!  No bubbles and sticks well.  This does NOT interfere with the touchscreen performance at all!!  Thank you for protecting my investment!
0.93090844	0.73218405	I don't like to put screen protector on because I always feel like that it gonna make screen darker. But the screen iphone5 just can't resist scratches, so I have no other choices. I just put this protector on, it is easy to use. and so far I couldn't feel difference about the resolution, brightness and the feeling when you touch the screen. It is indeed High Definition Clear Screen.
0.97199595	0.7429147	For the price, these went beyond my expectations! It's easiest to install under a vented hood for a speck free install. (As instructed by an amazon reviewer before me.
0.19782817	0.31754458	I'm not sure what to say...it's a screen protector. I applied it and now it's scratched but my phone is not. It does what it says it will. Good product!
0.96874547	0.74333715	I was a little off put by the somewhat matte finish to it, but my fingers enjoy the feel, and I don't get the greesie screen like you do with shinnier ones. I feel like this is really protecting my screen, which is important if you have ever lost a screen and paid +100$ to get it fixed. Overall I will buy this again...if needed ;-)
0.9668045	0.8386023000000001	These screen protectors fit perfectly. I didn't have any issues with bubbles on either of the phones I put them on. As long as the screen is cleaned really well prior to application, you shouldn't have any problems with bubbles.
0.6721264	0.72892463	Installation was a breeze. The instructions were clear & simple and you could always Google the best ways to putting on a screen protector.It doesnt have too much of a glare and it does not blur out the screen or make it fuzzy looking BUT...The only thing that bugs me is the oils on my fingers sticks to it and its way more visible than if I didnt have the screen protector on. Its not really a hassle to wipe it off with a cloth, but it does get annoying sometimes when you have to clean it constantly or if you didnt have a cloth on hand with you.Price & quality is great for the amount you get. My aunt got another brand with the same amount of screen protectors (3) and they were only $1 something. Her first one lasted about 2 months before she had to use another one so I do suggest getting this brand if you're looking for a cheaper/affordable screen protector.
0.99969876	0.8429406999999999	This screen protector is great! I love the matte finish, it's easy to apply, and performs perfectly.This product makes me love my iPhone 5 even more!!!
0.98915315	0.7659123000000001	This item it perfect for the iphone 5 and it is even easier to apply. I can not even tell that I have it on and it has no bubbles. The sellers are very efficient and friendly.
0.9940165000000001	0.81624967	The screen protect fits good with my iphone5, and easy to install without bubble.By the way&#65292;there are three packs, which are good quality and reasonable price.
0.38246858	0.17431843	Thanks this product really works but sorry I hate writing reviews! I bought two, for my boyfriend and my self! I will by more for back up but I don't think I will need it!
0.8106374	0.75617254	Had the protector for about a month now. Works just as well for the overpriced anti-glare protectors that they sell at AT&T!!
0.99916637	0.8695351	This is by far the best screen protector I've ever had.  Clarity is great and the application was a breeze.  But, the best thing about the protector is the smooth touch.  My finger glides without hesitation across the screen better than any other protector.  Great work Tech Armor!  I will definitely purchase again!
0.09147823	0.36337045	I was unable to get the sheet to adhere to the phone.  I purchased this similar product for my iPhone 3, and did have a problem with it.
0.99752855	0.85211337	After reading the instructions and watching the video on the Tech Armor web site, I successfully installed the screen protector on the first try. I did encounter a dust bubble during the process, but it was easy enough to lift the protector with tape, wipe the dust away, and smooth everything out again as described. The protector is excellent; I can hardly tell that it's there by sight or by touch. This was definitely the right product to purchase, I'm very happy.
0.98964554	0.74943304	I received the anti glare cover for my iPhone 3 days early. Shipping was fast, and shortly after I received it, I was sent an email from Tech Armor saying thanks for the purchase, and directing me to their website for instructions on how to apply the cover. The instructional video was easy to follow, installation was easy, and it seems to be a nice product. Considering the price (about half the price of what they are selling at the stores), and the customer service, Im giving this 5 stars.
0.99872816	0.814176	I highly recommend this screen, it is clear--no distortion at all--and it came with the necessary tools for a perfect installation: a lint free cloth, hard card and a sticky paper to remove any dust specks.  Great price too and fast delivery!!!
0.16302246	0.57588017	Anti-glare and anti-figerprint works well.  However, couldn't get one bubble out on installation, then a second bubble forms a few weeks later despite inside a rubber case.
0.011556447	0.20330799	I bought the Tech Armor Screen Protector for my new Iphone 5s. I read the directions and watched the video. It was impossibleto install correct. I lost my time, and wasted my money. The third screen protector I brought to professional place and they were not able to correctly install this product and they gave me a screen protector from another company. I am very disappointed and frustrated.All three Screen Protector ended up in the trash. Let me know how you plan to fix this problem.
0.97652817	0.8235181	Some other name brand actually not smooth when you try to glide your finger across the screen. This one is perfect smooth touch and very clear. Only negative is a little hard to line it up to the phone during install.
0.7616593	0.44456744	I purchased 2 packages of these for my iPhone 5 a while back and I have yet to open the 2nd package and have only used one of the three that come in the package. They are easy to put on and last a long time.
0.99830985	0.78935874	this product can fits my iphone 5 very well.the instruction and kit inside help me apply the film onto my phone very easily!It's a great buy! love it!
0.99541014	0.8279645	This screen protector is awesome!  No glare and no bubbles! I would definitely recommend to a friend. Went on easily.
0.9798228999999999	0.73102593	Tired of finger prints,smudges and scratches ? Then this is for you,the perfect compliment to the Otter Box. It's magic.
0.35655615	0.56915426	The screen protector is clear which is good. But, the cutouts are strange. The cutout for the camera and speaker at the top is just one big opening. instead of the more precise cutouts separately.also, the cutout for the home button is not a circle. rather, more like a thumb. leaving the opening between the bottom of the home button and the bottom of the phone exposed.
0.98752344	0.86089516	Very easy to put on. They even include a little sticky sheet to help remove any dust that might get stuck.The antiglare matte is definitely something you have to get used to. I have the ultra clear on my ipad and this on my iphone and while I like both its definitely for different reasons.I'm really not sure what's better, fingerprints/oil smudges with a perfect screen or no fingerprints/glare but with decreased clarity.
0.9978584	0.83900464	"I've had lots of i-Devices and we usually put invisible shields on everything, so when I got my iPhone 5, I looked at that again but I don't like the sheen you get with those so I wanted to see what else was out there.  This product was an easy choice since its got a million positive reviews.  Everything arrived as expected and using the ""hinge"" method to install, I had a nearly flawless installation on the first try.  I had a couple specks of dust in one corner and lifting the corner with some tape then rolling a pen covered with tape under the protector cleaned it up perfectly.  Now I have a flawless installation that looks just like glass.  It is really impressive. All the holes line up just right and there's no overhang on the edges like I got on my wife's iPhone 4 with incipio screen protectors.  Works perfectly with the Rearth Ringke SLIM case I got with the same order.I will be buying these again."
0.9502036	0.78635013	I've just received my Tech Armor HD screen protectors in today and it only took a few seconds to apply! Now I have to admit I kind of messed up the first protector, (out of a pack of 3) but that was my fault for rushing into the process without reading the instructions first! The 6-step instructions in fact are very simple and easy to follow. So after I read them, I was able to apply the second protector with NO, I repeat NO DUST particles trapped between the film and the screen! This is a big thing for me because previously about a couple weeks ago I ordered the splash MASQUE Screen Protectors (2-pack)from Amazon. Without going too deep into detail, both protectors had dirt and dust attracted to them as soon as I began to peel off the first protective layer!! I was very frustrated after spending more than twice as much $ for that product as I did  for this far more superior one! And the only reason I went for that particular brand first is because I've actually used them before on my iPhone 4s and the installation was and quick and simple just like this one was. But for some reason, that was not the case for the iPhone 5! I can't quite pinpoint why this process didn't work for my iPhone 5, but it didn't! And judging by other reviews I've read for the splash product, I wasn't alone as a lot of other people had the same exact problem! So this goes out to all of you guys/girls who are at their wits end with trying to find a quality screen protector that truly works! This is the product for you! This was honestly my very first review so I hope you guys find it helpful. P.S. I did manage to get one small air bubble trapped on the screen, but since it was just air and no dust in it, it was easily smoothed out with the card that was supplied with the product! Thanks!
0.36677045	0.49350837	No better than any of the others.  Still lots of bubbles on my screen after multiple attempts (and using all three protectors that come in the package).  This one is no easier to install than any of the others either.  So frustrating. At least it wasn't terribly expensive but if you read the reviews and think you have found the holy grail of screen protectors; you haven't.
0.9884583	0.7896924	This product is true to the description.  It went on perfectly and came with everything you need to apply it without fail.  I was shocked that it went on perfectly the first time!!  Since the pack came with three, I still have two more if I ever need them!
0.8516575000000001	0.82668316	I'm glad it came with 3 covers because after trying to put the first one on, I had to throw it away. They are very stick and some lint got on it and I couldn't get it off. Anything on the cover will show up as a bubble so make sure the screen and work-area are 100% clear. It is a bit tricky getting the alignment right so you don't cover the camera and ear-speaker. I had to peel back and apply several times to get it right. The provided bubble-eliminating scraper wasn't very strong and I had to use a credit card to work out the bubbles. Now that its on though, it is hardly noticeable.
0.9920120000000001	0.82195807	Good quality product for the price. Goes on easy and feels thin and durable. I would buy it in the future.
0.014672756	0.5554643	Unable to use this item because the holes in the screen do not match what is required for iphone 5S.  Cost for shipping to return is higher than the cost of the item as only UPS is allowed for return.  Fraudulent to sell this for iphone 5s
0.33156013	0.5760850000000001	The protection itself is fine - no complaints - but the film comes with a little tab to separate it from the backing. That was all well and good, but then when it was on the phone, the tab was near impossible to remove from the film and when I finally got it off, much of the glue remained on the top of the film that I had to get off with Goo Gone. I would think this would be one f the first things someone would quality test. Now it is fine, but I was shocked.
0.9681504000000001	0.8133055	"These screen protectors are always a pain to put on without the bubbles. But that's for any protector.  It comes with a wipe to clean off your screen before applying, which helps. The first time I put it on I accidentally touched the sticky-side and it caused the protector to have a few more bubbles than I was willing to live with. So I took it off and carefully applied the second protector, and only got a couple bubbles that are off the screen, so I am fine with it. Definitely give it some time to ""sit"" before you make your judgment on whether or not there are too many bubbles. Some will settle and disappear, others you can massage out to the sides of the protector. Others just won't ever go away.No issues with the transparency -- the screen is still very clear, the cutouts fit well over the iPhone 5 face, and I haven't added any new scratches in the week they have been on (I just wish I had gotten the protectors before I put a couple minor scratches on it). A good buy all in all."
0.52409637	0.5918681	I absolutely hate static cling screen protectors like this. No matter what I do I usually end up getting dust or some sort of small hair underneath it. I guess that is what I get for having pets!What I like best about Tech Armor is that you get three screen protectors. There is nothing worse than spending $15 on a screen protector, only to get some sort of dust/hair under it during the installation and trying to use tape to get the dust off (and most likely making it worse and throwing it out). It is nice that they realize this is a common issue and give you three to get it right.I actually did really well with my first installation. There is one tiny bubble of dust underneath where the home button is at but it is not very noticeable. If it ever really starts to bug me I have two more to replace it with!My installation method:* Turn on the shower at a high temperature and really steam up your bathroom (I read this causes the dust to settle)* Wipe down your bathroom right paper towels/windex whatever* Turn on the bathroom fan to suck up any dust floating around* Get out phone, wipe it down with the provided microfiber cloth, make sure there are no little pieces of dust or hair on it* Line up the corner and pray you don't screw it up!
0.9773566999999999	0.80072516	I have not had great luck in the past applying these screen protectors to my iPhones.  I've always begged the guy at the AT&T store to put them on for me.  What made this product easier for me were the instructions and the online video.  I actually got it right the first time!  It's simple moments like this I'm sure I'll remember when I'm 80.
0.9062800999999999	0.80113304	I had purchased a Tech Armor HD Screen Protector for my iPad, and couldn't be happier.  It installed on the first try, and still looks flawless after a year of daily use.When I purchased my iPhone 5s, it was a no-brainier as to what screen protector I was going to use.  I got the same results.  Easy install on the first try, and crystal clear application.  Due to my stupidity, I put a small knife in my pocket and it put 2 small cuts in the screen protector. It did it's job because when I removed the protector, the screen was still flawless, with no indication of my momentary lapse of intelligence. I hastily installed another protector in the dark and didn't realize until the next day I had left dust on the screen and had some bubbles.I emailed Tech Armor the following day and even though it was my mistakes that caused the problems, I had 3 replacement protectors in my mailbox just a few days later. I've had the professionally installed $30 protectors, and the HD protectors from Tech Armor are clearer, much cheaper, and their customer service is unbeatable. You can't go wrong with this product.
0.037003934	0.46084926	Besides the bubbles being a problem, there is an adhesive tag that leaves behind a gummy, sticky residue in the corner. I'm disappointed.
0.9900652	0.80348754	I was really pleased with this product. When applied properly and with a little care it is barely noticeable. Really a good product for the money. I will say that you need to clean the screen well with lint free cloth and compressed air to get all the little particles off. Try holding it in place with a piece of tape before removing the backing. This makes it line up perfect. Enjoy.
0.99637175	0.83056986	I definitely love this screen protector. Screen looks great. Keeps fingerprint marks to a minimum. Definitely does what is says. Would recommend .
0.9988893	0.8150900999999999	Fits perfect on my Iphone 5.  Easy to apply and provides great protection from scratches and other damage.  Easily wipes clean with a lint free cloth.  Lifetime free replacement guarantee.  Enough said.
0.99164176	0.8027972	The Tech Armor screen protector is an exact fit and provides protection that you don't even notice. Follow directions and carefully clean screen before installing.
0.9954016	0.8236462999999999	This is the first product I've ever felt truly compelled to post a review about - it's absolutely fantastic.  Super easy to apply, almost as clear as glass and durable.  My husband asked me to replace the screen protector on his iPhone 5 (single protector that cost twice as much as this 3-pack) after he saw how beautifully my phone looked and how much better the touch screen responded with the TechArmor protector.  Ordering another 3 pack to have on hand.
0.9928505	0.8454927	First, I'd like to say that I've used a variety of screen protectors for my iPhone 5, and this is by far the best.I was a believer of Zagg products and have used them on different phones for about 4 years now.I had absolutely no issue with them other than the fact that they are pretty pricey, especially since you only get once actual protector. As soon as I got my iPhone 5, I fitted it with one of those, and had no issues, until I realized that I was dealing with glare, and fingerprints more than I wanted to.I became somewhat obsessed with cleaning my phone, even going as far as carrying a microfiber rag to clean it several times a day, just because it honestly bothered me that much.Eventually, the protector started to wear, and I decided that I wanted to find a new one, but this one, with some form of anti-fingerprint protection.I went to Amazon as my first resource, and found my way to this product. At first, I was wary. The price was considerably lower than what I had purchased in the past and a number of reviews told of common flaws like clarity loss.I didn't think there was anything to lose, since the price was nice, and there were 3 screens included.The delivery was actually much earlier than estimated, even with standard shipping.The application process was actually really simple, and required no liquid adhesive like I've dealt with in the past. Honestly, I messed up with the first one because I aligned it incorrectly, and ended up getting dust underneath it.The second time, it worked perfectly, and aligned perfectly with no bubbles, or any flaws.The cardboard card that is included is supposed to help you push out bubbles, however, I found it to be somewhat flimsy, so I just used my credit card, and it worked better.Overall, I'm very satisfied with how I don't see fingerprints and it isn't an issue in broad sunlight.Call me strange, but I also love the matte feeling on the protector and how silky it feels, and how much easier it is to clean whenever you need to.
0.99426544	0.86093616	Also protects from glare.  I originally bought a screen like this to fit my ipad.  I was so pleased with that one, that I bought these screens for my and my gf's iphone.  The dust remover tape that it comes with is clutch to make sure you're able to remove any specs of dust/lint that might get between the protector and the device's screen, which would otherwise cause bubbling.  This makes for a much smoother application than you could accomplish without.I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.
0.51973575	0.6874338000000001	Pick it up 48 hours after you order. No need to get other ones. Very, very high quality.Attention please: I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY SKILLS TO INSTALL IT WITH NO BUBBLES WITH YOU.Please understand my poor English, it's not too bad though.Put your phone on a table - clean up the screen - kneel down (if table is lower than you) and look at the surface of your phone like this.'')  phone  - you will see dusts that you didn't notice before. clean them up-------------- table/-/-/- cut a small clear tape and have it with one of your fingers - as soon as you peel off the screen protector, face it down - clean up the screen with tape here and there very quickly, expecially the upper and down sides and corners - install the protector from upper side to the bottom.The most important thing to remember is that you have to work with your tape very quickly!!I have never been so frustrated for the bubbles.Good luck
0.99820185	0.801942	I'm now on my 3rd iPhone and I've tried screen protectors on all 3 versions I've owned.  I bought this for my iPhone 5 and am completely satisfied with my purchase.  I made sure and washed my hands thoroughly just like the online video suggested and followed all other instructions.  My screen went on flawlessly the first time.  Great product for a great price.
0.99288607	0.8482908000000001	I ordered these twice now for my personal phones as well as for family.  I used to dread putting these types of protectors on...the inexorable bubbles caused by dust or hobgoblins (which is what I came to believe).  These screen protectors are very easy to apply, fit the iPhone 5 perfectly and feel great to use.  If you are looking for a matte-finish screen protector, this is for you.  If their other products are as good as this one, I would look to Tech Armor for any screen protector need.
0.99931276	0.8849877	I've nearly used all other brands of screen protectors that are on the market and I can honestly say Tech Armor beats them all, hands down!  Goes on very easy, stays put and, (This is the game changer) NO BUBBLES!!!  I'm impressed how nice and bubble free it looks only after a few minutes after instillation. I highly recommend this product to anyone that's on the fence about this protector. I'm sold, and will be a customer for life!  Thank you for having a product that goes beyond what is advertised!
0.9916301	0.7747966	"The films by Tech Armor exceeding my expectations.  They were incredibly easy to install, they are very resilient, and the anti-glare is just the right amount of ""anti-glareness"".  I ran into an issue (totally my issue, not the product"" and contacted support. They promptly returned my email and had a solution!  The films are just a great investment and do not take away from the brilliance of the iPhone display.  I have used other brands of films in the past (and have been satisfied with them); but the anti-glare films by Tech Armor are more reasonably priced and work so well, I would go with Tech Armor again and again.  First and only choice.  A great product that was available on launch day."
0.971833	0.7815846	I originally purchased the HD Clear screen protector.  The quality seemed very good and installation was very easy.  I personally didn't like the glare/reflection from the clear protector, so Tech Armor's customer service quickly sent me replacements of the anti-glare model.  I found these to be easily as good as much more expensive options (including the Apple store).  That coupled with the best customer service easily gets this a 5 star rating.
0.76765454	0.69401217	I had purchased these screen protectors and had a hard time putting them on cleanly and I already was on my third screen.  Tech Armor immediately sent me replacement screen protectors and I finally got it on pretty well with only two small bubbles on the edges. Can't ask for more from them.
0.856022	0.726691	It took me a few tries to align this and get it on but once I did its worked out well and served the purpose; to protect my Iphone 5's face. No issue w/bubbles or anything like that thankfully but the screen does seem just a tad to short to completely cover the whole surface but overall its doing the job. Definitely worth getting if youre like me and want to protect your overpriced and subsidized Iphone.
0.9989716999999999	0.8118105	The best screen protector I have ever used. Simple to install, perfect fit, and best of all NO finger prints or smudges at all. Thank you Tech Armor
0.49548924	0.3272223	It is as advertised.  Won't mind if I buy it again.  I hope they have some thing for the back.
0.97422266	0.8193433000000001	First tip: read the instructions before you try anything, I wasted one of the protectors not doing this.I've had it on for a few days now and I have no complaints at all. The screen is clear, I feel protected with it on and it doesn't bubble easy, just make sure you clear all dust from the screen before application.Overall, insane value for money. Don't look further. You won't get a better deal.
0.9463381999999999	0.736213	I bought this product the other day. Due to my faults I get bubbles all over my screen. When I emailed the company they told me about different strategies on how to remove the bubbles and it worked! Also with out even asking they sent me a replacement pack of no charge to me. Great product great company!
0.9948135	0.8109788	These are super easy to attach to your phone.  Customer service is great (I didn't need them, but they offered any help I needed).  These may not be the best screen protectors, but they are solid.  For the price, it's a no-brainer!  Definitely recommend for anyone looking to find a good screen protector for a great price... I sure know I didn't want to spend $15 and up to protect my phone.
0.93366605	0.7470032	i had a privacy screen just like this and i was kind of confused to order this one since sometimes you dont really get what u think you getting on amazon but this was on point and i love it. it gives its privacy whitch you might want riding on the train or sitting in a waiting room and have people over your shoulder trying to peak at ur phone. i would buy again
0.99841434	0.81386006	Worked like a charm. no hassle. no bubbles. Very easy to install; did it on the first try. Great product. highly recommended
0.9832039	0.75525653	I choose this product because I needed it to protect my phone screen.Anyone with a cell phone can use this product and it is sold at a reasonable price.
0.9948899999999999	0.6958883000000001	Revised to say the manufacturers' customer service is the best. They care that you are satisfied, ship quickly and follow up to make sure everything went well.Love the matte finish - it looks great, I had trouble installing because of a hand tremor. They offer videos and tips on how to install, it is imperative you follow these because the tiniest dust particle will cause an air bubble.
0.95878613	0.8189006	First time getting this for my iphone.  Got it on the first time without trouble or bubble.  No finger print and no glare. It fits perfectly and no problem with hearing.
0.987726	0.80884063	This is a great screen protector at a great price! The screen protector goes on very easily. The service provided by the company is also second to none.
0.9941721	0.8025477	I bought a sector 5 element case for my I5. The case was great but the instructions were abominable. I messed up the case installation by getting cleaning cloth lint on the backing...Asked for another ... they said I can buy them on their site.I bought a tech armor and now am clearly installed and a very happy customer ready to pitchTech Armor for their great customer service and no brainer warranty.  Smart people smart product.
0.9813913000000001	0.8461962	No, No it does not! I bought these screen protectors expecting them to be some cheap one's you change out at the end of the month but no. These screen protectors have been tough, I dropped my pone across a concrete surface while at work and when i saw it i thought the screen was done for! To my surprise i peeled back the screen protector and all was fine!Bottom line:  If your looking to get the best bang for your buck these are the way to go! 3 screen protectors vs 1 from Zagg..... Tech Armor wins! BEST VALUE!
0.29609278	0.5803232	I found installation to be fairly easy. The camera opening at the top is WAY too big, but other than that it seems to fit fine.  I wish I could have both the HD cover AND non-fingerprinting - I can't stand the constant marks all over my phone, but the matte screen protector says it dulls the HD
0.49793729999999997	0.5145301	You can find a TON of iPhone 5 screen protectors on Amazon for $1 or even less.  However, spend the extra few $$ to get these.  I am super pleased with these.  I have a good amount of experience on applying screen protectors, I always still have to try a number of times to get it the best I can.  However, the first time I applied this one it was 100%!  You still need to be careful not to get any dust on the screen, but all the bubbles pushed right out with the squeegee.  This item also include a sticky sheet that you apply to remove the dust, you lift it up and then place your actual screen protector, very easy.  You literally cannot tell it's there!  Oh, don't waste your money on buying a rear face protector, for the aluminum backing of the iPhone 5, no screen protector will adhere to it properly, but this item doesn't even come with a rear protector.
0.8931398000000002	0.6879585	While the surface seems particularly susceptible to smears from either body oil or lotion, the protectors seem fine.  Application and cleaning prior to attaching require (as always) great care and patience for best result.
0.07910445	0.38088858	I received this item today and found that it was very difficult to install. Getting dust particles out was the most frustrating part because it left mini air bubbles. Unfortunately, I failed to install all 3 screen protectors and pretty much lost about $10. Shortly after, I discovered videos on how to easily install screen protectors. Just my luck. I'm sure this product has worked well for many people, but installing may be the biggest issue for people like me.
0.9844779	0.6864946999999999	Perfect product to protect your iPhone 5 screen & easy to install.  You won't be disappointed.  Don't hesitate to purchase to protect your device.
0.89717317	0.74238473	Very durable. Stick great and don't peel off by accident or with in time. I installed one incorrectly, and had an edge sticking out, still managed to stay on there until I decided to change it. Great price for what your getting.
0.9820196	0.8019569999999999	After a few weeks, the protector lives completely up to its name.  It fully protects the screen.  Better yet, it fitted on perfectly and without difficulty when applying it to the screen.  Left no fingerprints either, thanks to some handly sticky tabs on the film itself.
0.81377137	0.68105894	As promised.  Week to work well.  Durability seems good as I have had the one on my phone for a month or so.  You can't really tell that you aren't touching the screen directly.
0.99193645	0.74144614	the cutouts were't exactly lined up right but it still works. Protects the screen like it should, and it comes with three for some extras...bonus
0.9636406	0.62746096	I don't really know how to make pie but applying this product was a sinch. I've used other screen protectors in the past that required spraying my device with some liquid solution and then wait for it to dry. I was able to do everything with the device on, no bubbles and best part is they sent me 3 screens. Luckily I got it perfect on the first try. Great product! Would even recommend to my neighbor who I've never spoken to.
0.8707119000000001	0.78022015	They were slightly hard to apply, and they seem to scratch easily, but there are several in each package so I guess it doesn't matter. If one gets scratched you can always replace with another. Overall I like this as it protects my iPhone screen perfectly. Only con is the easy scratching of the screen protector itself.
0.9437106	0.77329075	Great Product - price and warranty.  Still a bit diff to get those 2 or 3 small bubbles, cover is easy to wipe off.
0.6839861999999999	0.581979	Usually this brand doesn't get a scratch easy but I already have a scratch.
0.98222375	0.69006026	Nice covers, stick well, no issues whatsoever.  5 star product.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a clear screen protector for their iPhone 5.
0.014616668000000001	0.50973505	Put simply, this screen doesn't do what it says it will.  You can still see the activity on the screen when viewed a person sitting next to you, its just appears darker.  I would not recomend this to anyone looking for privacy from the random stranger sitting next to you.
0.99328744	0.86503947	Got this set of 3 sheets that fit my new iPhone 5 perfectly. It's relatively easy to peel and apply the clear film to the screen. Once applied and bubbles underneath removed with the provided tool, the film is mostly invisible, even though it seems to attract dust and fingerprints more easily than the bare screen. It's good value at 3 sheets for $5.95.
0.95629305	0.80592203	I purchased this privacy screen protector as a replacement for my old eorn out old one (which didn't have the added benefit of privacy).  It was quite easy to instsll, just follow the instructions.  One small note though, it didn't come with two layers to peel back, just one.  It was very helpful that it came with dust tape remover; a huge plus for dust seemed to gravitate towards my phone's screen once I cleaned it with the lint free cloth.  Overall, the privacy screen looks great!  It is anti-glare and seems strong enough to deter scratches.
0.9789599	0.8533945	The Tech Armor screen protector was very easy to apply.  I was successful the first try.  No bubbles.  No dust caught underneath.  I did follow someone else's suggestion of applying it under the stove hood with the vent on.  The phone operates just as it did without the screen protector. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it shows every finger print.  But I didn't buy it to keep fingerprints off it.  I bought it to protect it from scratches.
0.9901359000000001	0.76878726	Happy with the quality and the service. Easily comparable to other screen protectors I have used. Arrived in the time frame promised.
0.9787533000000002	0.73536015	Well when i was deciding what product to buy i was a bit worried about this product based on the bad reviews. I do not have air bubbles, or dust particles, or can i even tell its there. Loved it. and in case i messed up i have an additional two screen protectors just in case. very satisfied.
0.99574465	0.8798551	"This is a great product, and the only screen protector you'll ever need to get.The most important feature I want to mention is the ""HD"" aspect. When clean, the protector can't even be seen when screen is on - the front of the phone looks just like the day you opened the iphone 5 while at the apple store!! As mentioned, there is also a soft cleaning wipe included and a sticky tape patch used to get the dust off while applying. In addition, there are three screens included to get the screen right.Everything else considered, this is the only protector you need to get, and plenty of enough easy to read instructions to get it on right.A must BUY!!!"
0.95068717	0.7980972	Installed it on my Iphone 5. It looks great, retain the Retina display quality. In fact it blends in so well that the camera cutout is the only place where you can tell that there is screen protector in place.Pro:CHEAP (go to the stores and see how much they charge!!)Comes in package of 3 (useful when you messed up for first try),Installation tools are includedDry install rather fumbling around with solutions that required 12hrs to dry.Cons: NoneInstallation tipsAirbubble that wont go away means you have dust or lint underneath the screen protector, Use masking tape to get rid of it. Remove all lint or dust before putting the screenprotector on (it might take a few minutes but it will be worth it)Never touch the adhesive layer with you fingers
0.21944416	0.5410286	I ordered this screen protector after reading reviews on Amazon. Tried twice to put on but I still had some bubbles(didn't want to waste the whole pack).  I've had the protector on my phone for about a month and had no problems.  It keeps my phone from getting scratched in my bag which is great.
0.9601786	0.7995886	I was glad that there were three protectors in the package.  Applying the first one was a disaster because I didn't take the case off of my phone.  When I figured out how to remove the case it was very simple to put the film on. I had a couple of pieces of dust under the protector but the small piece of &#34;tape&#34; included did what it was designed to do and took the dust off.  The screen looks great - absolutely flat.  The glare is gone and I am very pleased with the results.  It is every bit as good as the $25 protector the AT&T stores sell.  Best of all - no bubbles!
0.8932280999999999	0.6942209	The title says it all.  I has already saved my iPhone from a scratch, which is awesome, but it's a pain to attach.  However, it feels great under the fingers as it is smooth and very nice to use.
0.9885054	0.8013296	The tech armor screen protector is good, you have a clear viewing of your screen and it is easy to install.
0.19301084	0.47915095	I guess it's my fault that I ordered something I didn't want. I was under the impression that this would have more of an invisible shield/gadget guard feel, but it's almost like floppy plastic. I put one on my phone (the bubbles were easy enough to get out) and immediately noticed the change in texture. Whenever I slid my finger across the phone it made a swiping sound because of the material of the screen protector. I took it off immediately because that would drive me nuts. It seems to be an ok product if you don't mind the harder material. I'm going to go with a different shield that mimics the glass feel (probably invisible shield by zagg).
0.95572114	0.77395266	Solid iphone cover, installs easily and comes with everything you need. I'm not a huge fan of the matte finish, and is not quite as tactile as i would like, but for the price, you can't beat it.
0.9989375	0.79937506	Easy to install, great product, would definitely recommend this to a friend.  The screen protector looks nice on the phone as well. Works great.
0.9659718	0.82725084	This item was easy to apply and fits well. When first applied (or cleaned well) you cannot even tell it is on!! It does NOT take away from the beautiful retina display my iphone 5 provides!! My one and only complaint is that it smudges VERY easily!! However, a simply clean and the smudges are gone!!
0.28166529999999995	0.43945614	Shipping was super quick and I was excited to see how well these would fit when i opened the package and put it (wrapper on) on-top of my iPhone....however, I used all of them trying to make them bubble and dust free.I followed all the directions and watched a youtube video. They do come 3 to a pack but the first two I applied had air bubbles and found dust (where is all the dust coming from) and I ended up bending one which left a big air bubble and a crease on the protector.once it creases, game over. Time to try another one. The third one however went on pretty well and hopefully I won't have to change it for a while. I have been applying screen protectors to my iPad, iPhone, IPods so I know very how they are supposed to go on. This is the first time I have ever bent one and it creased. Once it was on, I liked it. But basically I paid for one usable one and two trials...
0.9744673	0.7268154	The screen protector went on very easily. And now that it's on you can't even tell. I'm very happy with my purchase.
0.91620576	0.7233236	Best I've ever used. Comes with the standard cloth as well as a dust removing tape to get every last speck off before application. I have zero air bubbles and can not tell it's even there. I doubt i will ever buy any other brand screen protector again.
0.61791956	0.6327182	Followed directions almost to a tee.  Almost, as in, I thought I was removing screen backing No. 1, and later found out that I had removed screen backing, No. 2, instead.  Glad there were three protectors included.  Second time was a charm.  Nearly invisible except at the very edges and around the ear piece, where you can see the cutouts.  Really nice fit!
0.49076757	0.7577559	So here it goes.Directions state that once film is on the face of the phone, there is a &#34;#2 tab&#34;  to pull off.  There was no #2 tab.Screen is very dark, great for security,  bad for your battery,  my brightness is almost always set to max unless in a very low light room.  This is the problem with security screens. But I am assuming part of the problem is that it was missing the ability to pull off the top layer.  It does provide good security from side viewing,  but doesn't take much  to get a decent view if someone glances over your shoulderDense screen composition provides great scratch resistance to the original phone screen and I feel provides great security to protect the screen from breaking when droppedAll in all, I would still buy this again  because it provides better shock protection over any other screen protector I have bought.  but if it doesn't come with the top layer to peel off, return it.  I would buy it at a retail location  for an instant gratification return.
0.9654163	0.7425654	This is the best screen protector that I've owned! It lives up to its name! No scratches or finger prints!
0.9976780999999999	0.8034756	Highly recommend this product, easy to use and does a great job protecting the face of the phone.  If you have any issues, customer support is very attentative.
0.99590504	0.88045835	I love these screen protectors.  You get no glare, fingerprints or bubbles.  These are without a doubt the best ones out there.
0.76901984	0.5053711	"I don't usually rate a product to be 5 stars but this was a product that really got me by surprise. I had concerns in purchasing this products because of all the negative reviews but decided to try it out anyway.First of all, the screen protectors did look scratched up but then I realized that the only part scratched were the layers you have to peel out anyway.Secondly, it was super easy to apply. I was expecting it to be difficult because I bought a life proof screen protector, otter box screen protector and (""the number one brand"") invisible shield protector and all got messed up because dust got in, bubbles were massive and irritating to look at and what not. But tech armor gave me no problems. Just search the application video on YouTube and you're good to go. On my first try I got it so now I have two extra.Then there's also the fact that it is so thin that you could hardly see it or notice it. You won't know it's there unless you applied it yourself."
0.63550025	0.5326810000000001	Was uncertain how much protection I would need for my iPhone... This seems to be just right! It was easy to install & I have not needed to replace it yet even though it came in a pack of three - I was not excited about the high shipping cost as it was almost more than the product!
0.49148524	0.46540105	I'm not sure if its my fault or the screen protector, but I thoroughly cleaned my phone before applying and I still ended up with dust and mini scratches on the protectors, maybe I just got a bad batch. However 1/3 seemed to be in good condition and it does what it's supposed to.6/18/14: Soon after my review, Techarmor contacted me to send me a brand new pack of protectors, great customer service! New ones look great.
0.02004975	0.3434999	I had lots of bubbles and couldn''t read the numbers at first on the tape marked 1 and 2 and the tape I tried to remove stuck to protector. Tech Armor said they would send more and did.  I still haven't put it on so no final conclusion as to if I can do it. I'm supposed to go to their site and see the instructions for installation there.
0.9908222	0.8359109	This is a mid-grade screen protector, exactly what I was looking for. I didn't need military grade protection that someone could shoot with a bullet and that cost me as much as my phone. I also didn't want some cheapy piece of garbage. This protects well, fits well, and has a great price.
0.94248974	0.77617455	Makes the screen slightly pixelated but feels great no bubbles easy to apply only used one screen out of the three.
0.87143826	0.7349611	So I used to buy the really dirt cheap ones that ship overseas. On a whim, happened to purchase these, can clearly see and experience the difference, these are exponentially of better quality, the screen appeared more crisp and clear, and I have yet to have a scratch on my screen, has protected it.
0.086520284	0.45687684	This is one of the worst screen protector I have ever purchased. The cut-outs do not align well. There is little adhesiveness making it  very easy to peel off.
0.25228745	0.43289983	For the first time I did not get lint between the phone and protector, and I did it to 2 iphones. No bubbles, smooth installation.
0.8262681000000001	0.5976937	Ratings 1 to 10, 10 being excellent, 1 being unacceptable1:  Ease of application:  102.  Durability (after 2 months):  103.  Overall:  10
0.9946734	0.8450106	Just installed on my iPhone 5 and it looks great!  Very easy to install, compare to other ipad and iphone screen protectors I've used in the past.  I was able to line up and re-aligned several times, with no issues.  Just make sure there's not lint/dust particles floating around.  Make sure the screen is completely clear and then make sure you push out any air bubbles and it'll look great.  Will definitely purchase again, if I use up the three screens that comes with each order
0.98702896	0.7570098000000001	I received excellent service and support from Tech Armor.  I urge everyone to watch the video before installing the Clear Screen Protectors to avoid needing  support, however it's good to know that if you need them they are available and very helpful.  The Screen Protector looks great and fits perfectly when installed correctly.
0.99118423	0.8373008	exactly what i expected. Exactly what i wanted.I was first introduced to matte screen protector when I wanted to change my black iPhone 4 into a white one. I found the colored screen protector and when I put it on, I realized how amazing matte is!  I am more careful with the 5 but i dropped my 4 all the time and the screen never cracked. Matte is the way to go. it doesn't look dirty or show my makeup on it. Its great! it stays clean and is easy to clean with just a tissue swipe.I saw other great reviews from tech armor on another screen protector, and i looked to see if they made a matte and they did! yay!Tech armor seems to be a great seller.  I will def buy this when I am out of the 3Also Its easy to put on. I start at the top and align around the camera and speaker and then i slowly place it while aligning around the button.The price is more than worth it.  And one protector will last a long while. lucky us it comes with 3!very happy!get this! you wont be disappointed.it ships fast
0.94252884	0.7173411999999999	What a deal.  Inexpensive and looks and feels like the same product that costs $20 and you get three of them.
0.9896393	0.85174286	I purchased the anti-glare anti-fingerprint screen protectors, and while they reduced glare and fingerprints, they sacrificed screen quality.  I let Tech Armor know and they sent me their HD Clear set free of charge.  I could see how the anti-glare anti-fingerprint screen protectors would be very helpful to people who are outside a lot or get dirty or messy hands could greatly appreciate them.  Whereas I am inside most of the day - I prefer the clarity over other benefits - either way, I highly recommend Tech Armor.
0.036430508	0.52173066	Its a screen protector. it does what it is supposed to do and does not give off the rainbow glares and is not super reflective.
0.9975953000000002	0.8409544	These screen protectors are great. Go on easy and good quality. Would highly recommend for anyone with the iphone5. Do not shine or show a big reflection.
0.98272073	0.802688	I have used many iPhone and android screen protectors and this is by far the best! I installed it in my iPhone 5 with absolutely no problems and NO bubbles at all, I didn't even have to use the squeegee that is included in the packaging as I ALWAYS have to use with other products like this. Just make sure you clean the screen and when you think it's completely clean, clean it again to get rid of all dust particles. Only had to try it on once after aligning it, instructions were very detailed (most don't even come with more than 1 sentence of instruction) and it went right on! Works so well, I ordered the same product for my iPad 3!
0.092317104	0.5442235	Packaging was good. Difficult to align the product at first. Successful after couple of tries. Screen looks good, although catches fingerprints and oil. Will probably look for the matt finish next time.
0.99619466	0.7954168	The product met all my expectations. It gives an elegant look to the iPhone and the installation video they provide is very useful to install the protector without bubbles. Very satisfied.
0.9939703999999999	0.7738391	love it!! product is exactly as discribed! love the fact that it wont leave fingerprints, the one i had before was shiny and always looked oily because of the fingerprints...
0.98984134	0.83110476	Tech Armor screen protectors are totally transparent and are almost like nothing is on your phone. The install was straightforward, no bubbles, dust or other issues. Solid product. We have them installed on 2 Galaxy S4s and iPhone 5 and they are working well in all cases.
0.0073128343	0.45250025	I went through all 3 screens and every single one I put down had no less than 15 air bubbles. Using the attached board did nothing to get the bubbles out. Complete waste of time and money.
0.996776	0.7565805	This is great if you are worried about people seeing what you're doing on your iPhone 5. Also you can't beat having extra protection for scratches.
0.9606680000000001	0.81556237	I went through three of a more expensive brand and still had a nasty job.  This one went on smoothly with the first installation.  Absolutely no bubbles and the resolution is incredible - really cannot tell any difference between a phone with it and one without.  So, it's five stars for now - will wait to see if I have any durability issues.One week update - So far I have accidentally had the phone in my pocket with keys. No problem with any scratches.  Dog who has scratched sofa many times jumped on the phone twice while it was on sofa and left no scratches on screen.  So far, so good.  Salesperson in store suggested I get a screen protector yesterday - was surprised it already had one and then tried to sell me something more expensive. The application job on their phone was awful compared to this.
0.8441464	0.72716606	Overall I really liked this product. They give you three and it's been more than 6 months and I am still going stong on the first one!
0.57395667	0.67158014	Compared to my last screen protector on the iPhone 4, this one is very easy to install and I had no bubbles at all. One recommendation, follow the instructions to start with the home button side. I did it opposite as I thought it will be more important to get the speaker and camera aligned 100%. However, these cuts are wider and so it turned out, that I did not hit the home button with the cutout perfectly. Already after two weeks, dust gets in and it is starting to lift at that point. That is maybe my error but I would suggest that the home button cutout should be slightly larger to have a better fit. What kind of annoys me, though, is the fact that this protector loves the grease from your fingers and ears. It is so much worse than the iPhone's glass without a protector that I am thinking of taking it off. The qualtiy is excellent though and I do not see any changes to the resolution or colors of my screen. After two weeks, no scratches at all. So, nearly perfect in installation, very good optic and material quality, however too much fingerprint sensitivity.
0.9720358	0.85483897	I have used Tech Armor screen protectors on my iPhone4s and my iPodTouch 5thgen so it was a no brainer to buy these protectors for my wife's new iPhone5.  Easy to install and if you miss align during the install just take a piece of scotch tape to lift up and realign.  If you lower the protector down slowly you will notice very few bubbles to squeegee out.  I did have a dust particle under one bubble but lifted up protector with tape and used the sticky tape that came with the kit and touched the dust particle and it removed it just fine.  Finished the install and my wife was impressed with how clear and unnoticeable the screen looks on her phone.  You get 3 screens with the kit and I have yet to have to use more than the first screen after several months of use on my phone and my iPod.  They seem to be quite durable as I keep my phone in my blue jeans pocket all the time and still looks new.  Oh and did I mention the price is great too.
0.020636708	0.38282263	Don't waste your money on screen protectors. They're a pain to apply and are ridiculously obtrusive. No wonder the manufacturer includes 3 screen protecters, because they know it'll take you at least 2 tries to get them on without an air bubble or piece of lint. In addition to being difficult to install, they scratch easily!!! I used the card that they supply to remove the air bubble and it left scratches all over the protector.
0.95554787	0.8816143	"I wanted a matte screen protector for my new iPhone5 and I ordered this 3-pack set from Amazon. It came in a comfortable packaging from Amazon and Techarmour provides one with a dusting cloth (2""X2"") good enough to clear out any dust on your phone and a credit card like thing to move out any air bubbles. There is a peel-off sticker on the whole protector sheet which needs to obviously be peeled off little by little as you stick the protector sheet on the phone. couple of points to note:1. make sure there is absolutely no dust on the phone before sticking the sheet on2. do NOT touch the sticky side of the sheet with your finger - since this is matte, it would show up on the front side3. align the sticker to the earpiece/camera/home button carefully. although I did peel off and re-stick it without any hassles, i believe doing it repeatedly would reduce the stickiness and will leave ugly finger prints.if there are any air bubbles, they can be smoothed out with the card Techarmour provides. At the end of it, the phone looks really cool with the matte finish and doesn't reflect off any light like a normal protector would. its really helpful when you go out in the sun.whats more.. you get 3 sheets in total :) good investment for a good phone"
0.003079772	0.53153336	I did not believe all the bad reviews and unfortunately they were accurate...I followed the instructions to the T on a brand new Iphone 5, cleaned the right way, used the card and etc.  Wasted all three protectors trying to get the bubbles out of the screen, it is just impossible as many reviews state.  I went to a retailer that had many options to choose from got it and installed it without a problem on the first try.  I mentioned to him that I had bought the &#34;Tech Armor&#34; one and could not install it and wasted all three.  He said told me that it is probably the worse one in the market, first because it is too hard and also because it had a coating of (??? - I can't recall), that makes it hard to install.The joke is that in their instructions they say that if we have problems to call them to get the problem resolved before writing a bad review.  So, if you know you have a bad product don't sell it.  I did not bothered calling them as I figured they would probably send me a new pack or just reimburse me the money.  For six dollars I rather write the review and try to warn other people so they do not go through the aggravation and the waste of time I went through.  Believe me - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!
0.98992157	0.61739945	I rarely leave any reviews about products I buy, but I had to with this one. I ordered it wednesday night and received it this morning (friday morning). Super fast shipping and easy to apply. My iphone looks great, thank you so much!
0.008965075	0.59983504	The installation instructions that came with these was completely wrong! It said there were 2 films to remove, there was only 1, and it also said that the tabs to peel off were at the top, and it was at the bottom. Also, the bubble squeegee that came with it to push out bubbles was made of flimsy cardboard which made it impossible to get all the bubbles out. I ended up having to throw it away and use a credit card.
0.25909978	0.489757	It is a good quality screen protector. The screen is clear and it does not have a fuzzy shade of some poor screen protector has.
0.87521666	0.59075546	true to its name, it fits the screen size for Iphone 5. Aptly priced!Great if it was sold only as one, i don't need three. I can buy later if required.
0.99185777	0.7506828000000001	I put my screen protector on yesterday and it works great.  There are no fingerprints or smudges on the face of my i phone.  I love it!!!
0.008642733	0.42134209999999994	This protector did not work out well for me at all. There were bubbles on all 3 protectors. This got me very mad. I went to bed and there were 2 bubbles on it, and when i woke up, there were 6! I could not get them out.
0.6846998000000001	0.6259425000000001	The screen protectors arrived quickly after I ordered them. They come in a pack of three. Normally it would take me three tries to get the protector on correctly but with this one I was able to put it on without leaving any bubbles the first time (I felt very accomplished). The only thing that was annoying was the little sticker that was on the screen protector left an obnoxious residue. I was able to take it off with alcohol but the alcohol seemed to dull the protector a little. Other than that, I have no complaints.
0.737636	0.6131223000000001	Just great product, does not feel like its a 5 dollar protector, but seems of higher quality. Looks great, as for durability, its been only a week, so its hard to tell.
0.34250695	0.4474135	It's super clear, but it doesn't stick too well to the phone.
0.7785619	0.6692840999999999	Well, so far this is the best screen protector ever! I had a lot of the expensive ones. They kind of protect but not like techarmor.  The others want you to mail back the worn ones, do not cover the screen like tech armor and to make it worst. They dont even hold agains my wife make up!Best one ever and with lifetime warranty theres nothing like it.
0.15650544	0.44971272	my screen protector scratches up immediately after application. true, the screen is anti-glare and matte, but there are so many scratches on it that it wouldn't matter any way.
0.89212906	0.8028759	This item fit my phone and went on fairly easily with minor issue with trapped air bubbles.  This is consistent with all screen protectors that I have tried.
0.8307336	0.68440753	good one.. worth to purchse it.. and once if any dirt on the screen u can easily clean it on this screen protector with normal cotton cloth. makes screen clear to view.
0.95111203	0.73425114	And a great deal for the price - basically 3 covers for the price of 1 cover at a lower price.
0.013938098999999999	0.3034864	I found this screen protector very difficult to install - went through all three protectors and still ended up with lots of bubbles under the surface.  Worse yet, the surface is sticky and not conducive to the swiping motion one uses all the time with an iPhone.  I'd rather not use a screen protector at all than rely on this one.  Skip it.
0.8634301999999999	0.71509814	I tried to do without a screen protector on my new iPhone 5.  But, after a month, I noticed one 'scratch' in the glass, and I was constantly wiping fingerprints, and other smudges from the phone so I could read it.  This is easier on the eyes (for me - no scientific proof here), and I&#34;m not obsessively cleaning my phone screen.  Definitely would buy again.The application was very easy too.  The protector is not flimsy, so it was very easy to put on.  I cleaned it really good, and followed the instructions and it came out perfectly.  I gave myself 15 minutes so I didn't feel rushed, and I got it installed in less than 5.
0.007767111	0.44912097	The screen protector made the screen look terrible. It was put on properly and it after being done and turning the screen on it had an all over haze that ruined the picture for everything.
0.9982998	0.75581	Instructions were easy to follow. Everything necessary for the application was included. And so far the screen protector is holding up great!
0.98812777	0.7822927	Highly recommend these! My new phone would have needed a new screen if not for this protector!A must for your phone!!!
0.71621484	0.6459986999999999	This film works great for protection but does dim the screen a little nothing too bad though. Worth the buy.
0.9710844999999999	0.74874604	I have bought two, one for iphone and one for samsung galaxy s4. The quality of screen protector is excellent.
0.99164796	0.68578005	I received the product one day earlier so I was really happy about that. The product itself is good but my initial try to put them on was not successful. I used all of them and still ended up with a few bubbles. This was the first time that this happened. My husband and I, both have been using iphone for more than two years and I have been the one who put these screen protectors on and I have always been successful on the first try. I really don't blame the product, though. It might still be my fault. The thing is when I was looking for iphone 5 screen protectors, this one seemed the best with the reasonable price.I still think it is, I just wish I still had at least one of them for my own iphone, I used all three on my husband's iphone.After I left this review the Tech Armor customer service contacted me in order to send me some complimentary screen protectors. They really do have a great customer service and I really appreciate it.
0.9984825999999999	0.8615472	As usual, Tech Armor provides a great product. The screen protector went on smoothly and is nearly invisible on my device. I love that they include a sturdy cardboard piece to push out air bubbles, as well as a glass cleaning cloth. I say this in all my Tech Armor reviews, so I will say it again; I will never buy another brand of screen protector so long as Tech Armor has one for my [future] device(s). If you are reading this and still not sure whether or not to buy this product; do it. You won't regret it.Hands down, the best screen protector I have ever owned across multiple devices.
0.97450304	0.7803333	Far better than a different brand I first tried.  Easy to install and does the job I bought it for.
0.7523297	0.7307895000000001	Easy to adhere to the phone, and it keeps scratches off of the screen. What more can add to this?
0.9976124	0.8322544	I have purchased many face plate covers and I have to say this product is superb!  The anti-glare is really good and truly clear and easy to view.  I can barely tell their is something on it.  Was extremely easy to apply as well
0.8379947	0.70330286	This is a nice product and easy to install. The only thing is the texture of the material is different from other screen protectors, but not a big deal.
0.9731332	0.79924	I hate putting these things on my devices. Invariably, no matter what I do, the protectors that come with the cases I buy are flimsy and are just never perfect (yes, I'm a tad ocd).These are AWESOME!! They use the usual two-tab system to place the plastic, but these are just a minuscule amount thicker, some how making it that much easier to put on. Placing them was so quick I was shocked; and there was no placing an replacing, no dust, no bubbles.Are you OCD? These are the protectors for your iPhone
0.9552375	0.64876056	I just deleted the old review written by me where I gave them one star. The original product they sent me was not very good. After I wrote the reivew, TechArmor commented on the the review and helped me. When it was established that the product was not good for me, they sent me a different one (AntiGlare, Anti Fingerprint) version of this for free. After applying that I became a very happy customer. Even the initial product I got was not that great, the customer service I receive from TechArmor was amazing and mind blowing. I highly recommend getting stuff from them. Thanks a lot to them.
0.7459209	0.53565186	Just applied one of these to my iPhone 5 and I can't even tell I have anything on there. I don't know how Tech Armor stacks up against other similar screen protectors but these work really good. It comes with three.
0.93360394	0.627689	Awesome screen protection and the screen clarity is bright and vivd. My only gripe is that the cut out for the speaker and frontal camera isn't centered.
0.9459474	0.77051103	After a bit of practice, the covers went on easy they have lasted and still look good. These were the first of this product we purchased, so have nothing to compare to
0.99924445	0.8470511999999999	By far the fastest and easy product to install...I've tried several. For the ease and quality the price is great.  I would definitely purchase again!! In fact going to order these for my ipad air.  Thanks Tech Armor!!
0.96825945	0.7972921	This matte finish lets the quality of the iPhone-5 screen-clarity shine through,  as it keeps the screen free from smudges longer.
0.99807465	0.76473427	I bought this tech armor screen protector because i zagg one was pealing off im so glad i got this screen protector its the best one ive ever had very happy with it and the price is amazing for what it is
0.9499011999999999	0.7190396	there great i cant find any better than these for my iphone, if your looking for a screen protector these are it
0.31192259999999994	0.5958949	This is a great product i just bought another screen protector before this it was 30 bucks for just one and it had anti glare no finger prints and all sort of weird stuff i put it on my phone it fell off the next week got it replaced and again fell off bit ypur guys seem to be holding pretty good
0.13916102	0.50881875	The quality of the resolution on my phone is great. Unfortunately this screen protector has a big hole for the speaker and camera, leaving areas of the phone exposed which is kind of upsetting. In addition, I didn't realize how much the fingerprints would show on the screen. If they bother you, I recommend going with a different screen protector.
0.1763494	0.366095	The holes for the speaker and home button are a weird shape, so I probably won't purchase again... but it will do for now
0.98614883	0.7815536	I used other brands of screen protector and this one is the best.  If you heard abt power support screen protector, this one has same quality as it with good price.
0.9161799	0.75068146	One of the screen protectors had a large scratch on it before I even attempted to put it on my phone... So that one I had to get rid of and then I applied one on m phone, easy instructions and easy application. Really just didn't like that one was already scratched before even attempting to apply to my phone.But screen protector itself is nice, nice feel to it and it's AMAZING that fingerprints don't show!
0.9974985000000001	0.7778206	Perfect investment on a reliable screen protector for a great price!!I barely buy items online and I must say this item is worth it!
0.32707697	0.6034590999999999	This product was advertised the best way possible, but the same was not true. There were 3 protectors given. While applying the first one, it picked up the dust particles from the cleaning cloth, The second one, had bubble and it does not go away even after 20 days. Adding to it the protector has picket up a scratch.
0.9629447	0.79535353	Works fine. Went to the bathroom and turned on hot water to put in on. No problem at all. Protects from minor scratches
0.9475832000000001	0.75783294	The screen protector is good and easy to install.. I always used to have air bubbles on my old iphones with any type of screen.. but It installed without air bubbles
0.9668708	0.7390944	I ordered this screen protector for my new iPhone 5 and i am using it from more than 1 week. This is really a good product and anti glare and anti fingerprint too. It gives a good feel when you move your fingers on it. I would recommend this product to any one.
0.9946408999999999	0.79437095	very good product worth of cost. nicely fits to phone. very convenient. the size of phone didnt increase in hand at all.
0.62049836	0.36437237	Did not like it after installation. Gives matt finish and also affect touch screen feature. The instructions to install are also wrong....though I managed to install it properly!!
0.9309414	0.78740275	Really good quality. No issues gluing to iphone (no bubbles for now!).This protector had plastic wrap on both sides - which really made the job of peeling those stickers easy.
0.9894233	0.767504	product was new, sealed and as described. Very happy with the purchase.I got three of them so I am covered if the current one wears out.Thanks
0.8501693000000001	0.7094914999999999	We put this on my sister's iPhone 5 a few weeks ago and it seems to be holding up to the constant use pretty well. Plus I have 2 others in case anything goes wrong!
0.008053839	0.52584755	"At first everything seems legit, nice packaging, says life time warranty on the front. Upon opening everything is neatly put together, but then their the screen protector itself, without even lining it up on the phone i can see that all the cutouts for the camera, speaker, and home button are not centered at all, if you do line them up it leaves the right side edge totaled not covered. The directions are misleading it says to pull the first tab called ""tab1"" then the second ""tab2"" while their is only one tab not labeled as anything. After putting it on I noticed their was a film over the protector that started to peel off. Maybe i just got a bad batch but be warned ill be returning mine ASAP"
0.9321518	0.7981982	Prep. is easy and as long as you keep the film facing downward after you peel #1 side off you don't get any particles (bubbles) on the surface.No bubbles and feels great to the touch.
0.73106825	0.66259485	The product came it a pack of 3 and it was pretty cheap. I was very easy to apply too.
0.9948376	0.79608715	This is a great product and I use one on all phones that I have owned.  Really saves the display, no scratches.
0.099279135	0.35580623	I bought this screen protector because of the great reviews. I had a very difficult time getting the cutouts of the screen protector to line up correctly. The instructions made it seem easier than how it is. If you do not clean your phone properly to get rid of oils and dust from your phone, you will get bubbles. I had to return and bought another brand that provided better installation instructions.
0.9923605999999999	0.74016416	IT keeps my screen private and protects from dust.  Its very good and I am happy I made this purchase
0.98170006	0.6576787	this product is just as it is described ,I'm very happy with it .I will recommend and I'll buy again if I need it.
0.050683587999999995	0.50587755	at least one of them didn't fit correctly, no matter what i did. Since i only needed 2 to work correctly, I was covered. So for what you're paying? not worth it. Will they be effective at protection - probably.
0.98998535	0.70489866	This product is really good. Easy to fix. Working with tech armor was a pleasant experience. Would recommend this product.
0.9723315	0.8429620000000001	Screen protector fits great and is very easy to apply.  Love the no glare, and especially the no fingerprint aspect of it.  Has stayed in place with no wrinkles, bends or movement for several months.  And when it finally does need replacing, I have another one already since it is a 3 pack!
0.9953742	0.77974355	I bought this Tech Armor screen protector for my new Iphone 5 and it does everything it is supposed to! It was extremely easy to put on, with step by step directions and an online video. I LOVE how matte it is, and the anti-glare thing is really true! Probably the best screen protector ive ever puchased :)
0.11715868	0.40198207	Very poor product.I'm not sure how there are so many good reviews but I am very suspicious.I never used the screen protectors before, but my friend told me to buy Tech Armor for my new Iphone 5.The screen protectors were worthless. I cleaned my screen to complete pristine presentation, applied the protector and BAM..... little specks bubbling up the film. So..... tried it again more specks!!! WTF! Cleaned it again, and WHAM!!! more specks. My house is not that dirty. I'm totally disappointed.I would try to get my money back but I would imagine that it would be a futile attempt. I guess at this price point this is what you get. I would think twice about buying this product.If the seller reads this and credits my account, I will tell about it. But once again, i'm not sure.I put two stars only because shipping was excellent and i liked the packaging.
0.01744008	0.45866549999999995	The item is not anti fingerprint at all! As I applied it, I noticed unusually high noticeable fingerprints, and the surface of this screen protector is somewhat coarse, and fingers don't simply slide on the screen. Corners of the film were bent a little and will not stay attached to the screen. I have contacted the company about possible exchange or return, but never heard back from them.
0.96738863	0.7767201	This screen protector does not take away from the screen, so there is no tint added you get your full definition display of your phone. Installation is really easy and Tech Armor even gives you a link that shows you how to install the product (http://www.techarmor.com/info/help). This is a really great product
0.9727468	0.7247775	Bought it for my 22 and 20-yr olds new iphones.  They love the anti-glare anti-fingerprint aspects of this screen protector.
0.9849114	0.81985795	I've been using this for a week now. We haven't had any sunshine so I can't test out the anti-glare function. What I've observed:Fairly easy to put on.Good finger-feel when using my phone.Fingerprints don't show.I have two spare protectors.Good value for the money.
0.799602	0.6825135	Seems to be a good screen protector. Not super strong because I already see some scratches after a few days of use. For the price it's great. Easy to apply and have three of them for later replacement.
0.48569053	0.55253977	I got this seeing the premium brand and some good comments, however the screen protector i got i used them all and seems to have always the edge unstuck, like pilled up... Does not look good. but i have now used up my screen protector... both my phones are having edges pilled up...
0.99367803	0.83650005	It was delivered very quickly and was very easy to install too. Everything required to install the screen protector without any bubbles is provided and it doesn't even take more than 2 minutes...My phone looks wonderful now ....
0.9687959999999999	0.58119506	Works just as good as the ones from the Apple store, but much cheaper! They shipped really fast, and I would purchase again!
0.91879046	0.62121475	I got it on all my handheld devices. Haven't found any issues with this protector yet. It does not get scratched easily and is very clear
0.9927232	0.8225631	These screen protectors are very clear, go on easily and protect my phone with a minimum of effort.  Love it
0.9892048000000001	0.84090614	These are easy to put on as long as you are careful and just take some time when first applying it to your iPhoneGreat screen protectors for iPhone 5 and helps prevent finger print marks. Only minor drawback is the matte screen finish diminishes the brightness and clarity of the Retina display a little bit.
0.79775345	0.72596496	i am very happy with my new screen protector. yes the matte finish decreases the resolution, but i prefer the fingerprint-free appearance. fits like a glove (the top looks like it's off center but that is only because of sensors)
0.746907	0.5150680999999999	It does not leave smudges and protects the screen from scratches - workable.  If you need something like that I recommend it.
0.37228373	0.63379234	Title says it all...  it's screen protection.Pretty much the same as everyone else's product.I'd buy it again, but nothing to set it above the others.
0.5143842000000001	0.6446677	I literally just installed these on both my and my wife's new phones.  Screen protectors have always been frustrating for me to install and this was no exception.  The video at the Tech Armor website was the only saving grace for successful installation.  I will update review when I can evaluate the durability of the product.
0.7096366	0.7594295	The price is right.  The instructions were not crystal clear but I was able to figure it out.  Ive had it for about 3 or 4 months now and it still looks like new.  I've had it in my pocket with keys and coins and hardly any scratches.  I still have the additional that came with it.
0.62297595	0.6309045999999999	its a great product and HDi like  itbut i thought its for the two sides of the phonein really , its just for the front side
0.91721964	0.7522051	This screen protector was easy to apply, just slap it on. There was a few bubbles during application but after some shoving they came out. When there's no bubbles, it's difficult to notice which is a good thing as it doesn't obscure anything. Overall, a decent product that will protect your screen.
0.024674296000000002	0.3107687	I have an iPhone 5s, and the screen does not fit my phone.  It is too small, so now I have to spend more money to buy another screen.  Would not recommend for iPhone 5 series.
0.9975687	0.89665604	It was easy to install and fits my phone perfectly.  I was afraid the non glare feature would be cloudy but it is very clear and hardly shows any fingerprints.  I highly recommend this product.
0.9942998	0.80246687	I love the feel of this screen protector, which gives me control. Does not feel slippery or sticky. The anti-glare helps to soft the display. It includes 3 protectors, which really helps. It took me two trials to get a perfect installation. I did not clean the screen very well the first time.
0.91348934	0.7470711999999999	The product is just like the description which is perfectly designed for iphone 5 and matched it well. It does have some mismatch on the top of the phone if you match the home button perfectly. Overall, it is a good product which worth buying. However, you may need to watch out it got pushed up by a bumper case if you have one. Mine bumper does push a small part of the screen protector up.
0.48082295	0.4797531	I received the screen protectors that do not have the elongated opening as to not cover up the sensor next to the speaker. I of course did not realize this until I had already applied the protector and then saw that the sensor was being covered. I emailed customer service around 7pm cst and received a response within minutes. Customer service verified my order number and has sent out the correct protectors to me. Customer service A+I have kept the wrong protector on until I receive the correct one and I am amazed by how invisible it is. I have had many of my friends messing around with my new phone this holiday weekend and almost all of them said something to me about getting some kind of screen protector on it before it gets scratched. It has been fun seeing there faces when I tell them that there is already a protector on it. Product A+Applying the protectors was so much easier than the ones that I have used on my previous phones. No getting the phone and your fingers wet to apply them and no waiting 24 hours for the bubbles to disappear. I messed up on my first try because I didn't follow the directions entirely by taking off the first piece of plastic (on the sticky side) all the way and ended up letting go too soon and it went on crooked. I removed it, reread the directions and the second installation was perfect, not one bubble and almost immediately it became invisible on my phone. Installation A+If you have an iPhone and you want to protect the screen, but you don't want a pain in the butt, non-invisible screen protector on it. This is the product to buy.EDIT - I received the 2nd wrong screen protectors without the elongated speaker hole that doesn't block the sensor, I received the 3rd and I have received the 4th replacement shipment. ALL OF THEM ARE WRONG. I have ordered so many things on Amazon and have not had one problem, but unfortunately Tech Armor does not know what they are offering and/or how to send the correct product. I now have to go purchase a screen protector from another company
0.9908017	0.6350939999999999	I was very pleased with this product. I make sure that I have one on every device now. Thanks Armor tech
0.23609650000000001	0.51966065	I ordered these for our new iphones at the recommendation of other people who also had bought a screen protector (and not necessarily this brand).  They work great but one already has a scratch on it, not sure how it happened but it's annoying so may have to buy another one.
0.9673287	0.44281816	I really like this screen protector .It is the best i never know before and The price is cheaper than other hd screen protector .I promise you will never be disapointed with this screen protector .I promise , i will tell my friends about product and customer service of you !!!! Thanks !!!!
0.9733716	0.7743043000000001	Works great, pretty easy to apply and to remove the plastic backing.  The only thing is that it's hard to line up with the screen exactly.  Doesn't have a bunch of bubbles like the last one I bought, so good product.  Nice and thick.  One caution:  follow the instructions in their video carefully, don't remove the sticky back all the way until you're sure it's lined up so you don't get your fingers all over it.  Scratches would be from scraping too hard with the card.  Bubbles would be because you were impatient in the part where you lay it down.
0.99887747	0.7744956000000001	It is the best and the vendor shipped it so fast, I only use tech armor for my screen protectors on my electronics, tech is the best hands down and I highly recommend the product and the company.
0.30573082	0.44325423	after i place the protector on the phone, and peel it immediately because there are bubbles and position not full match, the protector won't stick again. so i use another one.bottom line, make sure there are no bubble and position is full match the phone before you release the screen protector to phone screen.
0.21068856	0.48729295	after application the screen can't react as I wanted, and fingerprints is a issue, after several days scratches goes all over the film!
0.9787793	0.8370786	I bought this for my husband's iphone 5 and it fit perfectly. you don't even notice that there is a plastic film. it did not change the feel of the phone when you touch/swipe on it. it is a pretty great product and the price can't be beat.
0.95670354	0.7482203000000001	Although I keep my IPhone 5 in a book-like case, I felt I needed a screen protector just in case the items stored on the inside of the case (like my license) or something else scratched it.  This protector has a matte finish which allows your finger to use the touchscreen of the IPhone with little effort.  The protector was easy to put on.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
0.99859536	0.781567	Will definitely recommend it to friends.  When I got this, the price is great and it came in three pack as well.  Works nicely and I love the feel of the Matte screen protector.
0.9787259	0.7925988	This is a good product with a good fit. No more greasy fingerprints!  I would buy this again from this seller.
0.9450586	0.7180925	I am giving these a high mark because of the company response to my dissatisfaction with the way these made my phone look. Like it was dirty or had a film over it.  I called the company and they replaced them for free with the HD ones which are awesome!!! I totally recommend Tech Armor as a great company to deal with!
0.72562134	0.7333078000000001	This screen protector is exactly what I was looking for! It hides your screen without dimming it or making it difficult to see. It is also anti-glare which is nice. There is a slight grainy appearance to your screen, like you would get with similar anti-glare screen protectors, but it's not too bad and I barely notice it anymore after using it for a couple weeks. I'd recommend this to anyone, it's a great product for a great price!
0.99612284	0.8480804	the screen protector was easy to install.  I like the feel of it...slightly textured.  I highly recommend.  i don't notice any finger prints on it.
0.9985261999999999	0.80503553	This screen protector is perhaps the best thing I've come across recently. A friend recommended it. I have combination skin too, so this is perfect for when your face gets a little greasy in the summer, or right after easy french fries! haha! No more greasy prints on your phone screen!I highly recommend it.
0.96804047	0.78001285	Easy to install and fits my i-phone. Initially there seems to have some bubbles but managed to stretch and make it smooth!
0.7813726	0.72507966	It went on easier than I expected. I even had it down, peeled the whole thing back to remove some dust, and was able to reset it. It's very forgiving IMO. Nice product.
0.9766275	0.78946745	This is a good screen protector.  Fairly easy to apply (although any screen protector is a bit tough given all of the dust particles to deal with) and it looks great once it is on the phone.  I like the anti-glare, anti-fingerprint version.
0.98932296	0.81741357	I didn't really know what to expect from these things, but I ordered a 3 pack because I didn't want to go the 'monstrously bulky super defense case' route for my iPhone 5. I like how slim the phone is, and it's natural texture, so I didn't want to change that if I could help it, but I still wanted to add a little protection to it, just in case.These screen protectors are great. A little bit tedious to put on, but overall great. I got my first one on after a little bit of adjusting, readjusting and dust removal. It took almost 10 minutes to get it just perfect, but it's worth it. The protector does alter the appearance of the display just slightly, but in my mind not in a way that detracts from the device's use. The screen texture is now improved, there is less glare, and no chance for scratching. I also am able to use these in conjunction with a slim line case - I use the Ringke Slim (also on Amazon) and my phone both looks great and functions just the same as it did out of the box. I highly recommend this product.
0.97062755	0.82709056	"Title says it all. Good screen cover, fits perfectly, large ""bubble remover"" card, and good instructions. I am usually pretty good at putting screen covers on without leaving in bubble in the middle, there always seems to be a line down one side because the screen protector has to be put on in perfect alignment, otherwise it runs off. This one is slightly narrower than others removing this problem if you are only 99% straight. Would recommend, especially for the price."
0.42298156	0.52678937	I bought this clear case protector because I got a iphone 5s. It was easy to assemble, however what I did not like is there is a final tape you had to remove which leave tape residue on the screen.
0.80498874	0.78150856	Bought this along with a case from Amazon.  The protector came as advertised.  Easy installation and has a nice look and feel.  I like the matte finish and found it greatly reduces the glare.  The trade off of the matte finish is the image on the screen is a bit distorted but that is to be expected.
0.99728066	0.7468071	This transaction was quick and easy. I received the screen protectors (2 to a pack!) in a day, and applied one to my phone by following the instructions. It was quick and easy! I will definitely purchase again!
0.90945166	0.80778646	This screen protector is easily placed on the phone and bubbles are easily removed with the help of the plastic piece. Great product!! Would absolutely recommend.
0.99051076	0.86055243	This is a great product. It does not distort the image on the screen and does not give the screen a very different feel than it has without the protector. At the same time, you're getting the protection you need. It's also very easy to put on. This is an excellent product at a great price!
0.99793005	0.7652147	My screen protectors came today for my iPhone 5 and I absolutely Love it! I was nervous at first that I wouldn't place it on properly since I am so clumsy but it was a piece of cake. I like the idea that I have 2 more in case I would of applied it on wrong or need to replace one.  I wish I would of searched amazon first for my screen protector for my iPad before I purchased one from best buy.  I will be using Tech Armor from now on for all of my screen protection needs.  Its inexpensive, great quality, and invisible on my screen.  I can't even tell its there. Great job Tech Armor. I am one satisfied customer!
0.8645046999999999	0.72098273	I followed the included directions and the screen protector went on my phone very quickly and easily. I did not have any trouble with bubbles. Yes it attracts fingerprints, but I expected that buying the clear version. And it's nice having 2 extras in case I scratch the first one.
0.9839609	0.76062715	I bought this product a few days ago and it came in the mail yesterday. It actually came in before it was supposed to. Its a great product this is my second purchase with Tech Armor and I have nothing to complain about their products. The privacy sceen works perfect and this is just what I was looking for. I recommend getting this product and every product that they sell. If you have difficulties with their product just contact them, they will send you out replacement screen protectors. I guess people dont see that very often that companies do what they say without question. This product deserves 5 stars!
0.08826247	0.37581295	I purchased the screen protector for my iPhone 5 and I was amazed that the protector was not cut out correctly to the actual size of the iPhone itself.  I used 2 out of the 3 from the package to see if maybe 1 would at least fit properly and nope it did not fit, it actually was short on either side of the screen. Maybe I was the only one to get a bad package of these screen protectors but one thing is for sure I would not buy this brand of screen protectors again nor would I recommend them. I highly recommend the Otterbox Defender series case comes with a built in screen protector.
0.8599448000000001	0.54702234	Was as described, very clear, not hard to install.  follow the directions... make sure there is nothing at all on the screen and you'll be good.
0.9838979999999999	0.7341877	Easy to install, came with link to video that showed process as well. Well worth it for the lifetime guarantee.
0.9746094999999999	0.71166265	Product works great and shipped fast.  I am still on my first 'protector' thinking it may last a year or longer?
0.9955485000000001	0.84946555	purchased screen protectors from amazon was the same ones that verizon wanted $20 for they save phone from scratches and do protect face of phone great value and needed for face of phone easy to install and comes in a pack of three great
0.7934545000000001	0.6808635000000001	Best screen protector I've seen. The only issue I've had it that the screen is very susceptible to marring by items that come in contact with it in my pocket.
0.0064023435	0.44025868	Mailed mine to Tech Armor to be replaced - never heard from them! Don't buy for the warranty! You will be disappointed.
0.9995546000000001	0.82994276	Just as advertised - fits the iPhone 5 perfectly, goes on easily.  Highly recommended deal which arrived exactly on schedule.
0.10474607	0.34242433	I read the directions, cleaned my screen and still had dust particles under the film.  Finally got the third one to work satisfactorily.
0.99591756	0.7834763000000001	Comes in a pack of 3, which works great since both my wife and I have iPhone 5 devices.  Just wish this company would make smudge-resistant screen protectors.  Other than that, a definite re-purchase and I also recommend to anyone looking for a clean look at a valued price.
0.955614	0.8203575999999999	This product does exactly what it's supposed to. Doesn't leave fingerprints all over your screen a d there is no glare from the sun or lighting. As with all screen protectors you got to have a little patience but it worked out fine for me on the first shot. Glad it came with a piece of take though because as I was placing the protector down some dust was stuck and I was able to get or off easily.
0.9370151	0.62311244	Best privacy Screen ever, it really works!!!!!!!! You should but it, it's probably the best one you'll ever use and it's cheap.
0.9974226	0.8686569	Tech Armor's anti glare/fingerprints are awesome they keep the sun's rays from beaming off and glaring in my eyes. Finger printing is minimum. The protectors have great scratch protection too. very pleased with that. They stay on very well, when switching cases like I do.i like the look they give when on my mobile. I would definitely buy these and other Tech Armor products and I like that they include a sticker to get dust from under the screen.
0.9987253	0.9067656999999999	"This is by far the best protector I've tried for my iPhone 5 -Applies very easily and the two step process of removing the adhesive side and the protective side works very well! The second layer allows you to really push the air bubbles out without damaging the layer below.Using the card provided I got the air bubbles out with no problem - also includes ""dust tape"" so you can really pick up any lint after you polish the screen ...very helpful!The texture of the screen protector is great - its smooth and feel likes the actual screen and doesn't pick up as many fingerprints and some I've triedThere are three protectors in the box which is really good value for money!Would highly recommend!"
0.004466176	0.48850829999999995	THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR HAS A FACTORY MALFUNCTION AND LOOKS VERY BAD IN MY PHONE, NOT UNDERSTAND HOW AN ARTICLE SO EXPENSIVE NOT VERIFIED BEFORE BEING SENT TO BUYER  NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!
0.9944879999999999	0.7248496	Just great  ! And a good value for the moneyBought it before,and I recommend it to everyone .........
0.045520455	0.33827840000000003	I don't know if i got a bad batch or what. I have bought other Tech Armor products and had no issues, but these wouldn't install correctly, and looked like crap.
0.9896052	0.80725956	I am very impressed by these screen protectors. They provide a sharp, crisp display without managing to harm the display in any way.
0.21199483	0.52737755	I feel kinda bad for posting one of the few bad reviews, but I have to be honest here. It was very hard for me to install the screen protectors. I ended up using all 3 trying to apply them correctly, but each time I failed by either getting the adhesive side contaminated or failing to align them correctly. It was pretty frustrating, really. On the brighter side, some reviews mentioned GREAT customer service. If so, I'd really like a replacement!
0.9564741	0.77357054	It's the best screen protector, no reflection, looks good, easy to fit.strongly recommend to buy this one, do not buy other cheap one,
0.35520774	0.64099634	The product applied easily. I've had it a couple of weeks at this point and it appears to function as designed.
0.009356052	0.47908717	This inferior product arrive without the proper directions and is so dark that you cannot see the screen.  I contacted their customer service department and was promised that a replacement product would be mailed to me by the end of the week.  That was 6 weeks ago and I still have not received anything!  After contacting customer service 3 more times (and not receiving a reply), I have finally given up.  Don't waste your time or money dealing with a company that does not reply to customers.
0.973844	0.74958825	I luv this product. It does exactly what it says.  The matte finish is a must have. I never, never have finger prints. I do have to say it was a pain in the butt to get on for me. I did go through all three trying. Luckily I got it on the last one.  Yes I read instructions and watched the video etc...  So for the money and quality it is great. I just thought I would have leftovers for the future.  I bought for my whole family great stocking stuffers..
0.083779275	0.5698667	After reading so many great reviews, I purchased this 3-pack believing I would receive one of the best screen protectors for the iphone 5s available today.  Sadly, 2/3 of the protectors clearly had manufacturing problems, with a scratch in the plastic that quickly rendered them unusable. The 3rd wasn't too bad, but included an air bubble near the home button that wouldn't press out.I've use a number of protectors before, so I'm used to the installation process.  These simply didn't work for me. Too bad.I've written to tech armor's customer support providing order info. If it's as good as some others has stated, I should be receiving a new set within a day or two. If that's the case, I'll gladly come back and revise this review. If not...I guess I'll be using a different product from now on.
0.6447468000000001	0.495886	Maybe its just me, but I cannot fit these without having bubbles stuck on the screen - I am beginning to think these are just a cheap make!Update:After this review customer service emailed me and replaced the product for me with some handy instruction.This time it all worked fine with no issues! May I say their customer service is really good!!! Thank you!
0.8861406999999999	0.67117476	Despite what I read in other reviews about the installation, and it is easy.  Make sure the glass is totally clean of dust, fingerprints or marks before you attempt to install the screen cover.  I like the matte finish for no glare.  I only have used it for a week, so no comment on longevity.
0.98595536	0.7345607	This is Great protection, i just wish screen protectors were easy to put on!  Make sure you have time to focus on it.
0.9860460999999999	0.8515200999999999	I have used multiple screen protectors.  This one just slid on without a wrinkle or bubble.  It does not glare and shows no finger prints.  I love it! Been using it since Christmas and still no complaints.  It is idiot proof, hurrah!
0.99642766	0.9039915000000001	"The protective layers removal tabs are at the bottom, unlike some other screen protectors where they place the removal tabs at the top. This made it easier to apply because I can align it against the iPhone's ""Home"" button.I applied them successfully on my iPhone and my wife's at the first try. I've used the provided squeegee to remove the bubbles which where very few and I was really surprised at the results. Very clear film that I hardly notice or feel.A tip I read a long while ago somewhere else --thank you whoever you are-- is to do it in a steamy bathroom. Just turn the shower on hot for a couple of minutes to fog the bathroom a little, this reduces airborne dust particles and allow you to have very few or no bubbles during application.On top of that, a very reasonable price for a pack of three."
0.6726833000000001	0.60839605	"Originally 2 stars (changed it later)So the screen protector is matte and anti-glare.  I followed the instructions, and even watched the installation video, but even still, I had bubbles after multiple attempts ( I see why that at least 3 is necessary).  In the end, I gave up because I didn't want to leave the screen unprotected.I can actually live with the bubble because on my last attempt the bubble was minor and there was just one on the top corner.  However, there is a major minus to the protector.  I know that this isn't the HD version, but it really makes the screen blurry.  It looks like there are multi-colored pixel dots on the screen.  A friend picked up my phone and said, ""What is wrong with this screen?  I thought the iPhone 5 was suppose to have a good screen"".  But it really wasn't the screen but the screen protector.On the other hand, the protector is definitely anti-glare and anti-fingerprint.  Just extremely bad when there is a light background on the screen (really really bad).  It kind of defeats the purpose of having an iPhone 5 with great display.I would only buy this if you only care about fingerprints and not how it looks on the phone.  However, I think the price is pretty good hence its not one star.***Update October 8th, 2013 (upgraded from 2 star to 4 star)So after about a month, I got used to the multi-color pixels, and pretty much learned to ignore it.  A year later when I wanted to replace my screen protector (it had a lot of scratches) I ordered another one (accidently from the same brand...lol) and it was fine.  You just have to get used to it  (yet I do think the quality may have improved in the one year difference, it still has the multi-colored tiny dots, but not as blurry).  The new pack I got came with four dust stickers....omg that made things so much easier.  Installation was much smoother this time around.Over the year, I think I did like the matte finish and anti-finger print nature of it.  For the price, this is probably the best you can get in this category.  I have seen matte screens that look wonderful (its just too bad that I forgot to get the name of the company that made it), but this is fine for 5 dollars.Also, I would actually make this a 4.5 star (only because I don't give 5 stars unless its a pretty much a perfect product) because of the seller.  They actually contacted me about sending me a clear HD version of the screen after my 2 star review.  That was really nice of them, even though I never responded because I didn't see that message until now.  So I at least can say that this seller tries to make sure that their customer is happy which isn't always the case for everything on Amazon."
0.9990796999999999	0.70070404	Installation was easy for me and it really is anti-glare and anti-fingerprint. I love it! Great Great Great Great Great!
0.6371694	0.40915668	it is so so. The price is ok, and the protector also works well. But it is not that satisfied as i hope.
0.29072952	0.46355690000000005	this was so so, not to thrilled, very opaque. would keep searching for a better fit. used on iphone 5s.
0.99118114	0.8126986999999999	One of the nicest covers around, my little one dropped my phone on the concrete floor and this case saved it from anything happen to the phone!!!!!!It looks like it in nothing there but actually it is...Great Job
0.99105865	0.67807984	I got my screen protector early than the expected arrival date. I love it and it was exactly what i wanted.
0.32203709999999997	0.60968107	good product. doesn't have the shiny glare that other covers have. you won't see your finger smudges on this but its not resilient to other smudges (oil on skin etc.)
0.41155362	0.558733	I Failed applying all 3 protectors.when it almost worked though it looked great.Make sure you look up on how to apply the protector before trying yourself
0.98675996	0.7603763000000001	Very dedicated team. Thoughtful. Even offered dust removal tape. Even it's just a screen protector, I can feel the maker is dedicated to make it a better experience.
0.7543205	0.6096876	Well, I admit to not having hands of surgical precision, but these kicked my butt.  I wiped the screen, used the dust collecting tape, and had bubbles everywhere.  Next time I install, I'll watch the video first.  I used all three included screen protectors because it took me three shots to get it on, and the one I left on has a bubble in the far left corner and is crooked, but at that point, I was out of time and patience.  I'd recommend watching the video, even though I haven't seen it, because it probably makes the process easier.  I'll order again and watch the video before using.  The squeegee seemed to be a little flimsy, and I ended up using my credit card.  I don't know if the issue was me or the product, but at this time, I'm leaning toward it being me :)
0.26275048	0.48221320000000006	I was all excited upon receiving the item. It covers the entire screen and doesn't even feel like it's there! The thing is, i had hard time applying it so i ended up using all the three protectors without putting them on perfectly! So now i have an uneven screen protector on my iphone5. But otherwise, the Tech Armor is a good product
0.32122302	0.70907134	"A decent protector. Install was easy got it on my first try (not like the previous one I bought) for the most part. I do have two small bubbles in each of the top corners that I was unable to get rid off (boggles my mind as all other bubbles were easy to get rid of), so may give it a second go to try and rid the phone of those. There is slight friction when sliding your finger over the screen, it is not as smooth as the glass and your finger sort of ""sticks"". I am hoping this will go away with use, but will see. Also note, I thought this was a fingerprint ""free"" protector it is not, fingerprints galore.4 stars for the friction on the screen, but overall it is a decent protector. I was going to give it 3 stars for the friction and the fingerprints but reviewed the listing and couldn't find where it says fingerprint free, so my mistake.For the price I would recommend."
0.79280484	0.78508544	This product does the job and protects the phone against scratches and such. I appreciate the anti-glare quality of it, but it affects the quality of the image just a little, and it has a more matte-like feel when you touch the screen.
0.9910367	0.77197933	So easy to put on my new iPhone5. I also love the fact that has lifetime warranty not like the one I bought from My cell phone service provider.  I have plenty in case I get a small scratch on my screen ;)  Now my screen looks way better ..... HD clear!!!! =D
0.999648	0.8741869000000001	I have been using this screen protector for about a week now and I am 100% satisfied with it. Installation was easy and it looks fantastic on my new iPhone 5. It is crystal clear and difficult to even tell a screen protector is installed. What's great is that I have 2 remaining that I can install later if needed. There was also no issue using this screen protector with my Diztronic Matte Black Flexible TPU case which I also highly recommend. I had a Zagg Invisible Shield on my iPhone 4S, but in my opinion this Tech Armor screen protector is far superior in all aspects especially when considering you get 3 screen protectors at a fraction of the cost for a single Zagg protector.
0.8035861999999999	0.75259995	Good quality, easy to tape on  the screen. But not that strong, cuz a slightly scratch will damage the screen protector
0.36230445	0.27521740000000006	i don't understand why the review needs word required??? that just make no sense at all.  i have to count until the submit button works. otherwise, the review section gonna keep sending email to bother  me!
0.90069765	0.57477355	I originally posted a bad review due to the items I purchased did not apply correctly, was contacted by TechArmor and they happily mentioned they will send me out a free set of covers and even provided some guidance on making sure the next time I used the product that it will be as directed.  Looking forward to receiving the items which were shipped out a few days ago, have to admit Tech Armor really cares about customer satisfaction and a place I would definitely shop with again.
0.9719037	0.8031496	Prompt and sweet customer service, easily installed and no bubbles, ultra clear as stated without harm the retina display.But may feel a little bit sticky while dragging the screen.
0.8601597	0.7124136999999999	Overall, I liked the product and was quite surprised of how resistant it was. Been using it for about 3 months now and not a single scratch.
0.22418892	0.43213183	i tried to put all the screens on and they all had fuzz on them and left the screen horrible! I guess my money went down the drain!UPDATE: They contacted me and gave me some new tips on how to install the screen protectors along with another free replacement pack very good customer service!
0.96628755	0.75373507	This is just what it says a good clear screen protector that has held well to the phone while I have used it...
0.8734745999999999	0.74913526	Putting it on was pretty easy. Initially it had some bubbles but I was able to wipe them off. Its working very well.
0.98897487	0.8015892	This is one of the best protectors I've bought and get price. I had no issues with bubbles. Totally recommend
0.82921827	0.6836094	It was easy to put on to my phone. thais was my first i phone so i was a little skeptic. but it looks good on my phone
0.89542866	0.6773665	It's a great product, but mine came with a little slip on the top which I can't put down because it's like twisted
0.9703120000000001	0.76646054	This is a great screen. Not hard to install if you just do things right and simple as it says on the manual. Combined it with a poetic atmosphere case and you have the perfect package
0.9870343	0.7266252	Good screen protector, 3 come with so in case you mess up badly or it gets so scratched up somehow you can put another on. Quality is great and for the price can't be beat, beats buying anything in stores or from the cellular stores directly.
0.5974663	0.596431	Coming from a $2 privacy screen protector, I can tell you that the extra 6 dollars is worth it purchasing the Tech amor screen protector. Its smooth and it does its best at &#34;blacking&#34; out your screen to peepers at different angles. If you are familiar with privacy screens, if someone is directly behind you or right next to you they will be able to see your screen. Its not 100 proof however better than nothing at all.
0.91185	0.62369514	it does everything it says in the description. no complaints. i don't know what else to say. it's great. really.
0.9470115	0.70551366	this anti-glare & anti-finger print matted screen protector for iphone5 is pretty nice product. And shipping is fast. I would buy it again for sure.
0.7402751999999999	0.76786506	I've been pretty optimistic about this screen protector, seeing the numerous positive reviews on it. Once it came in the mail, I watched the installation video on their website, and had the protector installed on the first try. It wasn't terribly difficult and I'm pretty satisfied with the results. One thing to note is that the protector surface does have higher friction than the original glass surface. It could just be some residue from the mask so I'm going to wait a few days and see if it will wear off. Overall, this seems like a good protector that will do the job it was intended to do, at a great price.
0.097590595	0.32607102	I bought it and it came on time. I just hate this screen protector. There is an installation guide came with protector and it simply says there are two protective layer. However, once I applied it to the screen, it looks terrible and my iphone 5 screen is not as great as before, my pics does not look as great as before. I took it off immediately. I used one screen protector for my iphone 4 before (not this brand) and it is still great after almost 2 years later. I thought Tech Armor would be same but I was wrong. Do not waste your money for this expensive screen protector. Buy $2 screen protectors instead...
0.9161469999999999	0.7281529999999999	The screen protector is very crystal clear and easy to install. Good help video from 'Tech Armor' site.Note : For better result, you should watch the 'help Video' and try to install. It just take few minutes.
0.83352536	0.45415658	I gave 5 stars ! I wanted to give 4 stars, because for me it wasn't easy to apply on screen. But when my son helped me, he did just maybe 2 minutes and smooth. This protector very important for me or for my cellphone, because I like to keep my cellphone in my bag. Yes, separate inside special pocket but still will get scratch without protector.
0.3687284	0.455604	i failed with these three screen protectors. (it's not that easy as the video; i swear i did follow each step.) i wrote to them and they promised me a replacement around two weeks ago. it nevertheless turned out to be nothing - no replacement, no reply email, like they just disappear from the earth. what more can i say? DO NOT buy this stuff if you dun think you can install it successfully. they won't send you a replacement :( my iphone has no protectors for two weeks and i'm so upset with their customer service!
0.16447684	0.28155422	I bought these screen protectors before I received my iPhone 5s and thought that It was made for all versions of the iPhone 5. I'm getting the iPhone 5s tomorrow and I am really nervous to see if it fits because the package says &#34;For Apple iPhone 5&#34; I really hope it does fit, if not ill just have to buy a different screen protector.
0.39160459999999997	0.5905154	The plastic is very soft and scuffs easily(better the plastic than the screen).  Other than that each of the screens had an air bubble on the edge that will no go away no matter how many times you press it out.
0.28126296	0.5095261999999999	It seems like it would have been a nice screen protector if I could actually get it on. Maybe I am an idiot because other reviews say it is very easy to put on, but I messed up all three of them and wasted my money. You HAVE to have it EXACTLY lined up with every hole/button or else it ends up being off by a mile on the other side somehow.
0.951808	0.7957443000000001	This review is more about the customer service than it is about the product. First off, the product itself is great.  It prevents glare, prevents smudging, and is a quality screen protector.  I'm writing the review because I had an issue installing this screen on my iphone.  I sent an email to the support address with my issue, and they responded immediately.  Like, within 5 minutes, at 10:00pm at night! They issued a full return and sent it to me after a few simple emails.  within 10 minutes, a replacement was in the mail.highly recommend this seller, truly amazing customer service and support of their products.
0.8689549000000001	0.6393581	This privacy screen protector exceeded my expectations, the only thing that you should know is that it is thick, dims the screen, and makes the screen look oily/wet.
0.9144406999999999	0.73601043	I have 0 complaints about this product.  It came with clear instructions, tape to remove dust from the screen, and 3 screen protectors in case you screw up.  I followed the instructions carefully.  First I washed my hands, then wiped my screen with included lint-free cloth.  Then I sat under a light and checked for small pieces of dust, and removed them with the tape.  Finally I applied the protector carefully, squeegeed the bubbles out with the included card for such a purpose, and it was perfect.  Tiny bit off center, but the holes for the speaker and camera are big enough to accomodate that.  No bubbles, can't even tell the protector is there.Will buy again.
0.9971858	0.7874723000000001	anti-glare, anti fingerprint, love the way it looks matt on the phone, easy to clean, fits perfect and has a clean look, definitely will suggest friends/family to purchase!
0.6601366999999999	0.6614143	The screen protector was easy to apply. It came with a lint remover which was extremely helpful since I had a bare screen for awhile which caused it to not be as clean to start with. There were no air bubbles and the screen is now very smooth. I really like the matte finish.
0.9819984	0.7635562	Great protector truly HD barely can see it, also customer service is tremendous! A little tricky to put, but clean it throughly and go to the bathroom and turn on the shower to avoid getting dust in the screen RECOMMENDED
0.9685457000000001	0.88196135	First the price, you get three of the screen covers for just over $6... That's the best price I've found on a quality screen cover.  The quality of these screen covers are next to none, I put two on my phones and one on my dad's phone and didn't have a single bubble when I was done.  The screen is clear, perfectly responsive to the touch and protect the screen.  I dropped my phone on my wood floor and it slid on the screen.  The screen cover had a mark on it, but when I took the screen cover off the phones screen didn't have a scratch.
0.97474515	0.7578559	These covers are awesome. I love the matte feeling. Highly recommend.Getting them on is a pain though... but totally worth it if you can do it right. I managed the mess up the first 3, but the techarmor sent me three more. Managed to get it right the 5th time.
0.99887204	0.8854219000000001	I bought a otterbox case for my iphone 5 and it came with a screen guard. The screen guard was a bit slippery and left two air bubbles. I ordered this tech armor and I am in love! The screen feels great and looks great. Appears like there is nothing on the screen. The matte finish is really nice and feels great on the fingers. Does leave finger marks BUT I am always cleaning my screen with like my shirt or something and its easily erasable. It is non sticky too. I absolutely love it so glad it came with more than one. It also comes with a little card to compress the air bubbles. Do it right and you have no air bubbles. I highly recommend this for any phone.Update: I had the matte finish one prior to this edit. Now I purchased the HD ones because I noticed that after time the matte finish was taking away from the retina display. With the new iOs 7 update, I wanted my screen to look just as shiny and beautiful as everyones' iPhone. Therefore, I bought the HD and I love it. If you out it on right, no air bubble and you certainly forget there is a screen guard on. I love this screen guard and now I am a loyal tech armor costumer.
0.9934777	0.7892326	I still have a few bubbles, but it's gotta be my error in applying, they did their best and even include a card to push bubbles out.  With the price being under 10 bucks for 3, you can afford to take a mulligan on the first application.  Even with a few bubbles these are far and away better than the protector that came with my otterbox.  Much more sensitive and crystal clear.  I'll definitely recommend to my friends.  Srsly, why are you gonna drop 20 bucks at the mall when these are 3 for $7 and free shipping (prime)?
0.15903702	0.39651692	i do like this cover it feels like there is nothing on the glass it wasnt all that hard to put on had trouble with a previous order and this company did send out replacement at no charge will buy again
0.9962184000000001	0.77892756	These are the best screen protectors out there for an iPhone.  They are anti-glare, have a nice texture to them, and are easy to clean.  Excellent.
0.9651735	0.72967887	I like the guarantee and all but I can't really see it ever being needed. Plus, I like that they give you a hard cardboard item that resembles a credit card so you can smooth all the bubbles out...and a film that removes dust - much like I use to do with tape. They also include a cloth to wipe it down.Great deal!!
0.7932098000000001	0.7297146999999999	The quality is pretty good and very nice for this price. Only a little thing that it not very easy to swipe after put it on at first, but later it fixed.
0.053340226	0.38900268	The reason why I bought this was because the price was higher than everyone else, so I thought I was getting something with BETTER QUALITY than the rest. I was WRONG!The item came defective. I had to work my way around, spent nearly an hour, to finally get this thing on my iPhone 5. Still I have two annoying little bubbles! I am now looking for another one online to buy.I just wasted my money for nothing.
0.15208045	0.43755904	it was not suitable when i was use&#65292; anyway i am not satisfied with this product, but the price was ok
0.98600185	0.44181514	I like it ,very beautiful. i like it ,I like it ,very beautiful. i like it ,i like it .
0.121381134	0.46468723	After watching the instructional videos referenced in the installation instructions, I attempted to install the screen protector on my day-old 5S.  The installation went well until I attempted to remove the bubbles.  There was one bubble along the edge which I couldn't get to press out, even after trying the lint removal tape.  By the time I got done fiddling with the protector, it was so smudged it was unusable.  I removed it, used the lint free cloth to clean the screen and tried again with the same results.  Then, it occurred to me that the screen might have something on it other than dust.  After cleaning the screen with Windex, the third attempt was a terrific success.  The film dropped right in place and disappeared with little effort.  I only wish I had cleaned the screen to begin with....I guess that's why they sell them in 3 packs.  In the end, I like the product very much.
0.8071316999999999	0.74689525	The protector is a little smaller, so no bubbles on the edge. Good quality product fit this price. The shipping is fast, too.
0.29586756	0.60139143	bought a new incipio dual pro case, and wanted to buy a few screen protectors to go along with it (not realizing that the dual pro comes with a free one!)these seem to be of the standard quality and composition of other screen protector's i've seen, but i encountered a few issues.  first, these come with peel-off stickers that identify the adhesive side from the backing - unfortunately, on one of the screen protectors, this left a sticky residue that could not be easily removed.  also, the cut outs for the front camera and phone speaker are off-center and look askew.  so, ok, not great.
0.8848947	0.77970123	When looking for a screen protector, I chose this one specifically because it came with 3.  It seems that the home button cut out is cut a little too perfectly, so you have very little leeway on not being perfectly straight.  Anyone that has used screen protectors before knows that it is tough to be perfect and that you only have so many retries until you get that irremovable bubble.  That being said, the first attempt didn't work out too well.  Too be honest, the second try was kinda of a guess, but turned out I lined it up quite well.  Once on, I was able to get rid of the bubbles.  The little plastic thing that came with the product was a little flimsy, so I used my own card which worked better.With regards to the final product, it's on the phone, the screen looks great, and I'm very happy with it.  I'm glad it came with 3, and I have 1 left more in case something happens.
0.98140156	0.74181014	high quality screen protectors and come with instructions for anyone who hasn't used one before. They are reasonably priced and worth it.
0.19385487	0.63827586	Good screen protector and privacy functionality on the sun, not on artificial light, looks fine on white iphone, i will order one more just in case
0.99732107	0.7620534999999999	Very good purchase for the price! Worked well for my Iphone 5. Easy to put and so far it has done the job well. Great buy, all phones should have this cover to protect it!
0.99684936	0.849348	Does just what it should.  Very easy to apply with almost no bubbles. Protects my iphone 5 screen.  Fits perfectly.  What more do you want.
0.59831953	0.69203234	I wasted my first one for a few bubbles left around the corner. So I gave a second try and it was very successful. No bubble at all. And it looks nice on my phone. The only problem I have is that after I put on the screen protector, it's easy to leave fingerprints on the screen. And I have to clean it a lot to keep the screen from looking greasy.
